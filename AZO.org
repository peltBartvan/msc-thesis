* Introduction
The need for efficient solar cells needs little explanation.
Amid global warming and pollution concerns, clean forms of energy, such as solar photovoltaics (PV) are becoming more and more important parts of the global energy portfolio.
When choosing whether to install a PV system or not, one of the major consideration points will be the cost of the system.
The most straight-forward way of driving down this cost is to make the solar cells cheaper to manufacture through for example cost-optimization of the cell or scaling up production.
This approach has its limits though, as the costs of the solar cells themselves accounts to only a small part of the total system cost.
For this reason, increasing the efficiency of the cells is key to driving down the costs of a PV system by reducing the number of modules to be placed and space needed.
Sadly, the solar cell market is suffering from the scarcity of some important materials, notably: silver and indium.
Indium is used in indium tin oxide (ITO) films on the fronts of cells to conduct the generated photocurrents towards metal contacts, which in turn are made out of silver.
Simply speaking the problem is this: front side contacting materials are expensive, and they are not expected to get cheaper anytime soon.
Can we use other, cheaper, materials instead, while not compromising on efficiency?
In this work, aluminium doped zinc oxide (\AZO{}) is investigated as a contact material by looking at its optical and electrical properties.
Previous work focused on the lateral conductivity and optical transparency \cite{MasterThesisDGJA} and passivation \cite{melskens2018}, in this work the contact resistivity between \AZO{} and doped silicon is investigated.
The same work also showed an annealing step to greatly improve the material properties, but only if an aluminium oxide (\AlOx{}) capping layer was present during annealing \cite{BasPassivation}.
In this work, the effects of annealing, capping and doping of both the \AZO{} and c-Si substrates are investigated.
To study this contact resistivity, a novel method has been devised, which is explained in detail in the second part of this thesis.
Luckily, very low contact resistivities were found, showing good potential for \AZO{} contacts in novel cell designs.

# SAMPLES A
To study how its optical and electronic properties are influenced by doping, annealing and capping, \AZO{} was deposited on silicon wafers with 450 nm thermal \SiOx{}.
On some of these samples, a capping layer of 30 nm \AlOx{} was deposited as this was expected to enhance passivation.
After thermal annealing, optical and electrical properties were measured through spectroscopic ellipsometry, Hall measurements and four point probing.
# SAMPLES B
Besides a good in-plane conductivity of the \AZO{} films, the ability to form good contacts on silicon is critical for applications in solar energy applications.
To study the contacting behaviour of these layers another type of sample, referred to as type B, was used.
In these samples the doping of both \AZO{} and Si were varied.
As will be discussed later, the type A samples show good characteristics when annealed at 400\Celsius{} and 500\Celsius{}, after which they degrade.
To focus on this temperature range all type B samples were annealed to either 400\Celsius{} or 500\Celsius{}.
For comparison with other solar PV materials, some similar experiments were done on LPCVD poly-Si.
On both sides of these samples, \AZO{} was deposited, followed by an \AlOx{} capping layer.
After annealing to activate the surface passivation, the capping layer was selectively removed using a wet etching process, so that the \AZO{} films on both sides of the sample could be electrically contacted.
To ensure good contacting and help reduce current spreading effects, 300 nm of Ag was deposited on both sides of the sample.
The sample processing steps will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
*** Oxidation
Samples of type A feature a 450 nm thermal \SiOx{} layer which functions to electrically insulate the deposited \AZO{} from the rest of the substrate, while also enhancing the sensitivity of SE.
In the type B samples, a native oxide layer was removed using a 1 min dip in 1% HF at room temperature.
After this oxide removal, a 30 min UV/O$_3$ oxidation was performed at room temperature using a Novascan PSD Series UV Ozone Cleaner.
*** ALD process
\AZO{} and \AlOx{} films were deposited by thermal ALD using an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor.
The table and wall were kept at temperatures of 200\Celsius{} and 180\Celsius{}, respectively.
\AZO{} was deposited using a supercycle approach consisting of diethylzinc (DEZ) or dimethylaluminumisopropoxide (DMAI) alternated with \HHO{} doses.
To control the Al doping levels, the ratio of DEZ and DMAI cycles was varied.
Overall, for a given cycle ratio $r$, the supercycle consists of $\frac{r}{2}$ DEZ/\HHO{} cycles followed by one DMAI/\HHO{} cycle, followed by $\frac{r}{2}$ DEZ/\HHO{} cycles again.
Cycle ratios of 16, 24, 48 and 96 were used in addition to intrinsic, undoped, ZnO.
In this work, the \AZO{} doping level will be indicated by the letter 'r' followed by the cycle ratio or the abbreviation 'int' for intrinsic.
# How many cycles per sample?!
After \AZO{} deposition samples were optionally covered with 30 nm ALD \AlOx{}.
In the symmetric type B samples, the recipe consisting of \AZO{} deposition followed by \AlOx{} deposition was run, after which the samples were flipped, and the recipe was repeated.
*** Annealing
Type A samples were sequentially annealed between 300\Celsius{} and 700\Celsius{} in steps of 50\Celsius{}.
The anneals up to 500\Celsius{} were performed on a hotplate in ambient air, while a Jipelec rapid thermal anneal (RTA) furnace in 10/90 mixture of H$_{2}$ \slash N$_{2}$.
All anneals were performed for 5 min.
To check if the sequential annealing procedure compares well to a direct anneal to a specified temperature, a series of capped r16 \AZO{} type A samples was annealed to the specified temperatures.
*** Etching
To enable contacting of the type B samples, the \AlOx{} capping layer was removed after annealing.
This was done with a selective wet etching process that favorably etches \AlOx{} over \AZO{}.
A 60\Celsius{} 0.1 M solution of \text{Na$_2$CO$_3$} was used, the pH of which was controlled to be around 11.8 through addition of KOH.
Some type A dummy samples were annealed and etched for different times, after which layer thicknesses were measured by SE.
*** Silver evaporation
To enable good contacting and reduce current spreading effects, both sides of the type B samples received a 300 nm Ag coating by e-beam evaporation.
After deposition the edges of the samples were cut off so that no shorts occur through silver deposited here.
The need for this Ag coating and the contact resistivity measurement will be discussed in detail in the second part of this thesis.

** Measurements
*** Hall effect measurements
The Hall effect has been used to measure carrier density and mobility of type A samples.
In this work, measurements were performed using a Lakeshore 8400 series Hall measurement system.
Samples were cut into approximately 9 mm by 9 mm squares, taking care to cut away any \AZO{} deposited along the edge of the wafer.
The samples were mounted on a sample holder using four probe pins, which were firmly pressed against the sample to make contact with the \AZO{}.
Due to the small thickness of the \AlOx{} capping layers, these did not need to be removed prior to measurements, as the probe pins were able to puncture them.
After an Ohmic contact check, the sheet resistivity of the \AZO{} film is determined using the Van der Pauw method (TODO: sources).
When the sheet resistivity is measured, the sample is subjected to a magnetic field of 1 T, and the hall voltage is measured, from this the carrier density and mobility can be determined.
*** Spectroscopic ellipsometry
The optical properties of the deposited \AZO{} films were studied using Spectroscopic Ellipsometry (SE).
As the photon absorption by free carriers is considered an important loss factor in TCOs, an ellipsometer with a broad spectrum was used, including near-infrared wavelenghts.
This makes the ellipsometer sensitive in the free carrier absorption range.

*** Contact resistivity measurement

**** TODO Include van der Pauw measurement theory
How much?
Probably not needed to put in an explanation similar to Dennis's thesis, just refer to the Hall measurement handbook and the original paper by van de Pauw.
**** TODO What SE type?
**** TODO Elaborate quite a bit more on SE analysis.
How much more though? I should include the used model.
I think results, including a discussion of the fits should go in the results/discussion chapters.
Should I just let this be a "I used this apparatus, data analysis will be discussed later" section?

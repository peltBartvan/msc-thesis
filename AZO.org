# SAMPLES A
To study its optical and electronic properties, \AZO{} was deposited on silicon wafers with 450 nm thermal \SiOx{}.
On some of these samples, a capping layer of 30 nm \AlOx{} was deposited as this was expected to enhance passivation.
After thermal annealing, optical and electrical properties were measured through spectroscopic ellipsometry, Hall measurements and four point probing.
# SAMPLES B
Another type of sample was used to study the contact resistivities of deposited \AZO{} on substrates of c-Si with different doping levels and, for comparison, on polished and textured polysilicon.
On both sides of these samples, \AZO{} was deposited, followed by an \AlOx{} capping layer. After annealing, the capping layer was selectively removed using a wet etching process, so that the \AZO{} films on both sides of the sample could be electrically contacted.
To ensure good contacting and help reduce current spreading effects, 300 nm of Ag was deposited on both sides of the sample.
The sample processing steps will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
*** Oxidation
Samples of type A feature a 450 nm thermal \SiOx{} layer which functions to electrically insulate the deposited \AZO{} from the rest of the substrate, while also enhancing the sensitivity of SE.
In the type B samples, a native oxide layer was removed using a 1 min dip in 1% HF at room temperature.
After this oxide removal, a 30 min UV/O$_3$ oxidation was performed at room temperature using a Novascan PSD Series UV Ozone Cleaner.
*** ALD process
\AZO{} and \AlOx{} films were deposited by thermal ALD using an Oxford Instruments OpAL reactor.
The table and wall were kept at temperatures of 200\Celsius{} and 180\Celsius{}, respectively.
\AZO was deposited with using a supercycle approach consisting of diethylzinc (DEZ) or dimethylaluminumisopropoxide (DMAI) alternated with \HHO{} doses.
To control the Al doping levels, the ratio of DEZ and DMAI cycles was varied.
Overall, given cycle ratio $r$, the supercycle consists of $\frac{r}{2}$ DEZ/\HHO{} cycles followed by one DMAI/\HHO{} cycle, followed by $\frac{r}{2}$ DEZ/\HHO{} cycles again.

** Introduction

** Background
*** Solar cell parameters
Loosely framed the goal of this work is to find out if \AZO{} passivating contacts can make /good/ solar cells.
To start answering this question, let's first narrow down what is meant by a /good/ solar cell, before diving into the details about contacting layers.
The purpose of solar cells is clear: to convert thermal radiation into usable electrical energy.
In the ideal case, the incoming thermal power, $P_\mathrm{in}$, is totally converted to electrochemical power, $V_\mathrm{out}I_\mathrm{out}$.
Thermodynamically, this total conversion is forbidden, the best we can do is to maximize the efficiency,
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{V_\mathrm{out}I_\mathrm{out}}{P_\mathrm{in}}.
\end{equation}
Since we cannot control the power output of the sun, this task practically boils down to maximizing the $V_\mathrm{out}I_\mathrm{out}$ product.
Two useful parameters of this current-voltage characteristic are the short circuit current, $J_\mathrm{sc}$, and the open circuit voltage, $V_\mathrm{oc}$.
As the output current depends on the output voltage, these two limiting cases are not enough to know the cells efficiency, so a third parameter, the fill factor (FF) is introduced.
Ideally, a solar cell would sustain full current output without a decline in output voltage, operating at an output power $V_\mathrm{out}I_\mathrm{out}$.
Realistically though, there is some optimal operating voltage, $V_\mathrm{MP}$, at which the cell produces its maximal power, delivering a current $I_\mathrm{MP}$.
This ratio of /real/ output power and /ideal/ output power is what defines the fill factor:
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{FF} = \frac{I_\mathrm{MP}V_\mathrm{MP}}{I_\mathrm{sc}V_\mathrm{oc}}.
\end{equation}
\todo{plotje IV karakteristiek + FF}
In terms of these cell parameters, the efficiency can then be expressed as
\begin{equation}
\eta = \frac{I_\mathrm{sc}V_\mathrm{oc}\mathrm{FF}}{P_\mathrm{in}}.
\end{equation}
Measuring these cell parameters requires the fabrication of complete cells, to optimize a \AZO{} contact we should shift our focus to directly measurable material properties.
Among the desired qualities of a contact are a high transparency, good passivation and a low series resistance.
Let's take a look at how these parameters influence the overall solar cell performance.

A typical high school explanation of solar cell operation goes as follows:
1) A photon from the sun is absorbed by the solar cell, here it rips an electron apart from an atom in the crystal, transferring its energy.
   The electron is negatively charged, but the void it leaves effectively has an opposite charge of equal magnitude, this void is called a "hole".
2) The electron finds its way to one contact of the solar cell, while the hole finds its way to the other.
3) The electron /really/ wants to get back to the hole, and the easiest way to do so is to go through the device that you want to power.
   The electrical energy from the electron is then transferred to the device, providing useful energy.

This rudimentary explanation completely skims over the complex thermodynamical nature of this energy conversion.
Moreover it fails to answer basic questions such as "but why do the electrons and holes move away from each other if they attract each other?" and "okay, so the charges made it to the contacts, why would they not just go back the way they got there instead of taking the whole wire/device detour?".
Despite these and several more shortcomings, this simple model can give us some meaningful heuristic insights into what is needed to make a good front contact.
Let's go through the explanation again, and see what can go wrong with each step.
1) A photons should transfer its energy to an electon-hole pair, what if it can't?
   This can occur due to several reasons.
   1) The photon does not have enough energy to create an electron-hole pair in the base; that is, the photon has an energy below the so-called bandgap of the solar cell's base.
   2) The photon does transfer all of its energy to an electron-hole pair, but the electron-hole pair loses some energy afterwards.
      This process is called thermalization, by collisions with the crystal atoms the electrons and holes lose energy until they get stuck at an energy similar to the bandgap.
   3) The photon might not even get to the base of the solar cell.
      If the photon is absorbed in the front contact or reflected by the metal interconnections, its energy is effectively lost.
      For this reason the front contact should obviously be as transparent as possible.
   4) The photon is reflected.
      If a solar cell reflects a photon back towards the sky, the photon's energy will not be of much use.
      A few strategies are used to keep photons trapped in a cell, texturing and antireflection coatings.
      While light trapping is very important for solar cell efficiency, it will not be further discussed in this thesis.
2) Maybe the electron and hole don't make it to their intended contacts.
   1) An electron or hole could reach the wrong contact.
      In the high-school explanation this sounds very likely, after all, the positive holes should be strongly attracted to the contact that's filled with negative electrons (and vice versa), right?
      # In solar cells, contacts need to be selective to ensure that charge carriers are separated, how this can be done will be discussed later \todo{where?}.
      A crucial part to this selectivity is that the contacts should be highly conductive to one type of carrier, while highly resistive to the other.
      Thus, for n-type contacts a very low electron resistivity should be obtained.
      A more in-depth discussion of selectivity will be given in \todo{waar?}.

   2) What if the electron and hole don't even make it to the contacts?
      It's possible for the newly formed electron and hole to recombine with each other (or with other electrons and holes), if this happens their electrochemical energy will be lost (of course energy is conserved, but from an engineering perspective it will probably not be useful energy anymore).
      One possible mechanism for this is radiative recombination, in which an electron and hole form a photon.
      Luckily, this rarely occurs in crystalline silicon due to its indirect bandgap, which means that some additional momentum is needed for this reaction to occur.
      In crystalline silicon, the most significant recombination pathways are Shockley-Read-Hall (SRH) and Auger recombination.
      In the former pathway electrons can make small jumps in energy using crystal imperfections, these small jumps are more likely to occur than a single large jump.
      The latter uses a third electron or hole to absorb the excess momentum that makes a direct transition improbable.
      Suppressing recombination is very important for efficient solar cells, and it is referred to as passivation.
3) Maybe the generated charges do not transfer their energy to the intended load.
   This can happen if a parasitic series resistance is present in the circuit, as these create potential gradients.
   In these gradients the electrons lose some useful energy, which cannot be used in the device.
   For this reason all parasitic series resistances should be minimized.
   This series resistance can be attributed to a few contributions.
   First, the carriers need to experience a low resistance during transport from the cell bulk to the contact, this is called contact resistivity.
   Second, once in the contact the carriers should freely flow towards the metal connections, for this a low in-plane resistance is required.

With this oversimplified treatment of solar cell physics, it already becomes clear that highly transparent highly conductive contacting layers are essential for efficient solar cells, moreover, a high degree of passivation should be achieved so that the generated free charge carriers do not recombine.

\AZO{} is a material that has gained attention for being highly transparent and conductive, at the same time it offers passivation on c-Si, giving it a unique combination of properties.
Previous work has shown that a good passivation can be achieved by hydrogenation of surface defects by annealing the material while it is covered with an \AlOx{} capping layer\source{todo}.
This combination of capping and annealing has been previously studied within the PMP group, resulting in a publication that includes parts of this work\source{paper}.
There (and in this work), the presence of a capping layer was found to be critical for achieving a high in-plane \AZO{} conductivity and transparency.
An important remaining piece of the puzzle is then to find out whether a low contact resistivity can be achieved as well, this is the focus of this work.

To do this turned out not to be an easy task, put shortly: measuring contact resistances of \AZO{} films is difficult to do by conventional methods which often require patterning and etching to create sample structures.
Furthermore, the presence of the \AlOx{} capping layer makes it impossible to directly contact the \AZO{} film of interest (at least for contact resistivity measurements).
\todo{link to etching, this is described in part I}

Due to these metrological difficulties a new measurement method was designed and implemented, which is discussed in detail in the second part of this thesis.

For the first part of this thesis, let's dive into the really interesting question: does \AZO{} make good solar cell contacts?

As a start we'll rid ourselves of the thusfar handwavy (and dramatically oversimplified) solar cell description so that questions can be framed quantitatively, so far it's only become clear that the contact resistivity should be low, but how is it even defined, and what is low enough?
Then the experimental methodology will be discussed, including sample preparation, process parameters of interest, and measurement methods.
Following will be an outline of experimental work on in-plane resistance and transparency, and how different process parameters influence these.
This part of the work was done in partial collaboration with Dennis Loeffen, who discussed these fully in his masters' thesis\source{Dennis}, here these results are treated with less detail, focussing on what these results can tell us about which process conditions are needed to obtain low transparencies and low in-plane resistances.
Finally, it will be shown that \AZO{} contacts can have a promisingly low contact resistivity on c-Si, moreover, this can be achieved in a process window in which the other relevant material properties are also excellent.
*** Contact resistivity: why relevant
In this section \todo{or chapter?}, we will look into solar cell physics in some more detail.
For a better understanding, a thermodynamic description of charge carriers in a semiconductor is needed.
Semiconductors are defined by having a bandgap, a band of energy values for which no electron state exists.
An electron is then either moving around in the conduction band, or bound to an atom while in the valence band.
To move between the bands, energy needs to either be supplied to an electron in the valence band, or an electron in the conduction band needs to somehow get rid of a considerable amount of energy.
These generation and recombination processes don't happen instantly, which enables electrons to stay in the conduction band for quite long times.
The states within the valence band without an electron are called holes and they can be seen as carrying a positive charge, essentially due to the /absence/ of an electron.
This property is what distinguishes semiconductors from metals, in which no bandgap exists, in metals electrons are always free to decay into available lower energy states.
For nondegenerate semiconductors the densities of electrons, $n$, and holes, $p$, can be well described by Boltzmann statistics:
\begin{equation}
n = n_\mathrm{CB}\exp\left(-\frac{\ECB - \EFn}{k_B T}\right);
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
p = n_\mathrm{VB}\exp\left(-\frac{ \EFp - \EVB}{k_B T}\right).
\end{equation}
Here $n_\mathrm{CB}$ and $n_\mathrm{VB}$ are the densities of states in respectively the conduction and valence bands, $\ECB$ and $\EVB$ are the energy bounds of the conduction and valence bands, and $\EFn$ and $\EFp$ are the so called Fermi levels of the electron and hole ensembles.
For thermal equilibrium it can readily be derived that $\EFn = \EFp$, but this changes when electron-hole pairs are actively generated.
In this non-equilibrium situation, one can ask if Boltzmann statistics can be applied, after all, this is a result in equilibrium thermodynamics.
Luckily, it typically takes picoseconds for electrons (or holes) to reach equilibrium among themselves, meanwhile, the equilibration between conduction and valence bands is much slower, electrons can take up to milliseconds on average to make the transition.
This means that electrons can be considered in equilibrium, and so can holes, just not in equilibrium with each other.
The excesses in electron and hole densities can be described by an increase in $\EFn$ and a decrease in $\EFp$, a phenomenon called Fermi level splitting.
Due to the absence of a bandgap, the separate equilibration of electrons and holes does not occur in metals, furthermore thermal equilibration is a very fast process.
This implies that, in a metal, the carrier statistics can be described by a single Fermi level: $\EF{} = \EFn{} = \EFp{}$.
So far, the Fermi levels have been interpreted merely as a useful way to parametrize the carrier distributions, but they carry greater physical relevance.
A more physical interpretation of the Fermi levels is that they correspond, up to sign, to the electrochemical potentials of both carriers, i.e. $\EFn{} = \eta_n$, $\EFp{} = -\eta_p$.
The free energy of an electron-hole pair, which we want to extract, is then given by $\DEF{} \equiv \EFn{} - \EFp{}$.
An interesting consideration: in the previous chapter recombination was described as categorically bad, the free energy picture gives a more nuanced view.
As the free energy of an electron-hole pair is given by the Fermi level splitting, free energy is only lost when recombination occurs in a region with split Fermi levels, such as the bulk of the cell.
In a contact, since there is no Fermi level splitting, recombination does not amount to free energy losses, and is actually necessary since without contact recombination no currents can flow.
This picture also gives a more quantitative description of the heuristic "electrons want to move from one side of the cell to the other, transferring energy to the device".
As the carrier statistics are described by only a single Fermi level in the contacts, the goal is to create a Fermi level difference between the two contacts.
To see how these contact Fermi levels are related to the split Fermi levels in the bulk, we can write down the carrier flux densities as follows:
# note: particle currents!
\begin{equation}
J_n = -\frac{\sigma_n}{e} \nabla \EFn{},
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
J_p = \frac{\sigma_p}{e} \nabla \EFp{},
\end{equation}
where $\sigma_n = e n \mu_n$ and $\sigma_p = e p \mu_p$ are the conductivities of electrons and holes respectively, expressed in terms of the elementary charge and density and mobility of the specific carriers.
In the n-type contact, the Fermi level should be as close as possible to $\EFn{}$ in the bulk.
As the Fermi levels need to come together in the metal, a direct consequence is that a strong gradient in $\EFp{}$ is needed in the contact.
This asymmetry between a strong $\EFp{}$ gradient and an ideally constant $\EFn{}$ can be achieved through the associated conductivities, the n-type contact should be very conductive to electrons, but very nonconductive to holes.
There are multiple ways to achieve this, but in this work we'll look at a homojunction in which the carrier densities are influenced by doping the bulk.
# A conventional way to achieve this is by n-type doping of the contact, which strongly increases $n$ and strongly decreases $p$.
# This contacting scheme is known as a homojunction,
An additional benefit of contact doping is that it reduces recombination at the contact surface by lowering the minority carrier density.
This reduces the SRH recombination rate, but at the same time the increase in majority carrier density can lead to Auger recombination in the highly doped region, so a compromise needs to be made.
The recombination current in the contact can be parametrized as \source{todo}
\begin{equation}
J_\mathrm{rec} = J_0 \left(\exp\left(\frac{\DEF{}}{n_d k_B T}\right)-1\right),
\end{equation}
where $n_d$ is an ideality factor, typically ranging between 1 and 2, and $J_0$ is a scaling factor.
As a large Fermi splitting is a design goal for solar cells, the most interesting parameter for reducing recombination is $J_0$.
Somewhat counterintuitively, $J_0$ mainly impacts cell efficiency not through $J_{sc}$, but through $V_{oc}$.
This is because at high recombination rates, lower carrier densities and thus less Fermi level splitting are achieved.

To wrap things up a bit, there are essentially two properties that a good passivating contact needs:
- High majority carrier conductivity :: To encounter Ohmic losses, as parametrized by $\sigma_n$. In the rest of this thesis the associated /resistivity/ is used, defined by $\rho_n \equiv \frac{1}{\sigma_n}$.
- Low recombination rates :: As parametrized through $J_0$, to enable a high Fermi level splitting.

Assuming the rest of the solar cell to be ideal, these two parameters can be used to calculate an upper limit for solar cell efficiency, this relation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:rainbowplot}.
Note that the efficiency barely depends on $\rho_c$ when $\rho_c < 100$ m\Omega cm^2 \todo{typeset unit}, in this range the cell efficiency is not contact resistance limited.
In this thesis it will be shown that these low contact resistivities can be obtained!

*** But first: what about transparency and conductivity?
Before diving into contact resistivities, let's first look at what is required to make the \AZO{} films transparent and conductive, conductivity here implying in-plane conductivity.
The bulk conductivity of an n-type conductor can be described in terms of its carrier density and carrier mobility,
\begin{equation}
\sigma = e \mu_n n,
\end{equation}
to reach a high conductivity, obviously the mobility and carrier densities should be maximized.
Reaching a high carrier density can be rather straightforward, simply dope the material strongly.
However, high carrier densities also result in increased free carrier absorption, making the material less transparent.
This can be quantified by a Drude absorption model, for which the complex dielectric function is given by
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon(\omega) = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 - i \omega \omega_\tau}.
\end{equation}
Here $\omega_p$ is the so called plasma frequency, which essentially is the maximum frequency at which the carriers can follow an external field, is is given as
\begin{equation}
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{e^2 n}{\varepsilon_0 m^*}}.
\end{equation}
The material will be mostly transparent to frequencies above the plasma frequency.
The parameter $\omega_\tau$ is called the scattering frequency, and it broadens the onset of photon absorption, so that photons with $\omega > \omega_p$ can be absorbed as well, it is given as
\begin{equation}
\omega_\tau = \frac{e}{m^* \mu_o},
\end{equation}
here $\mu_o$ is the /optical mobility/ of the material.
For transparency, both $\omega_p$ and $\omega_\tau$ should ideally be minimized.
Note that the plasma frequency increases with the carrier density, which conflicts with the high carrier density required from conductivity.
More straightforward is the role of the mobility, which increases conductivity and decreases the scattering frequency, making high mobilities very important for transparent conductive materials.

** Methods
\todo{eerst measurements, dan sample preparation}
In this work two distinct types of samples were used.
The first type, hereafter referred to simply as type 1 samples, were used for measuring the in-plane electrical and optical properties of the deposited \AZO{} films.
While no contact resistivities were measured on type 1 samples, they allow us to focus on the more relevant parts of our parameter space in the later contact resistivity experiments.
The second type, referred to as type 2 samples, feature two \AZO{} contacts, enabling passivation and contact resistivity measurements.
# dubbelop
In contrast to the type 1 samples these samples are symmetric, featuring a substrate with contacts deposited on both sides.
These were originally intended to be used in carrier lifetime studies, but in this project a method was developed to also measure contact resistivities with relatively little added effort.
The fabrication of both types of samples will be discussed in more detail in the following sections.
*** Measurements
**** Spectroscopic Ellipsometry
Spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE) is a method that is often used for measuring a myriad of thin film properties.
The method is a form of spectroreflectometry, in which not just the amplitude but also the polarization angle of reflected light is measured.
While no direct measurements can be performed, optical models involving material properties, thicknesses, and other parameters, can be fit to the measured spectra.
In this work, SE was mainly used to determine layer thicknesses and free carrier absorption in the \AZO{} films.
Free carrier absorption can be described by the Drude model, which relates the complex dielectric function, $\varepsilon(\omega)$ to the plasma frequency, $\omega_p$, and the scattering frequency, $\omega_\tau$ by
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon(\omega) = -\frac{\omega_p^2}{\omega^2 - i \omega \omega_\tau}.
\end{equation}
The plasma frequency can be interpreted as the onset frequency of free carrier absorption, it is given by
\begin{equation}
\omega_p = \sqrt{\frac{e^2 n}{\varepsilon_0 m^*}},
\end{equation}
where $m^*$ is the effective electron mass.
The onset of absorption is broadened by electron scattering, so for large scattering frequency,
\begin{equation}
\omega_\tau = \frac{e}{m^* \mu_o},
\end{equation}
absorption can be significant for frequencies above the plasma frequency, amounting to optical losses.
For transparency, it would be beneficial to reduce the free carrier density, while increasing the carrier mobility.
This is in partial contrast to the needed conductivity, for which a high carrier density is required.
For both transparency and conductivity, a high mobility is thus beneficial.
\todo{move the theory above to background.}
In this work, SE was mostly used to measure layer thicknesses and the two free carrier absorption parameters previously mentioned.
**** Hall effect measurement
Hall effect measurements can be used to determine in-plane electrical properties of thin films, such as sheet resistance, sheet carrier density and sheet carrier mobility.
When combined with a film thickness measurement, SE in this work, the more familiar bulk resistivity, bulk carrier density and bulk mobility can be calculated.
When a magnetic field is applied to a sample conducting a current, the moving charge carriers experience a Lorentz force,
\begin{equation}
\vec{F} = q(\vec{E} + \vec{v}\times\vec{B}),
\end{equation}
since the currents are confined to the sample, a counteracting electric field is formed, so that the Lorentz force equilibrates to net zero.
While the electric field itself cannot be measured directly, a Hall voltage can be measured between two points on the sample's perimeter.
It can be derived\cite{vanderpauw1956} that this induced Hall voltage is independent of the probe positions, as long as the driven current fully passes between the two probes.
Furthermore, this measured voltage is found to be equal to
\begin{equation}
V_H = \frac{I B_\perp}{n q t} \equiv \frac{R_H}{t} I B_\perp,
\end{equation}
where the Hall coefficient $R_H$ is defined as $\frac{1}{n q}$.
Since the total current, $I$, magnetic field magnitude, $B_\perp$ and film thickness, $t$, can be experimentally controlled, the Hall coefficient can be measured.
By itself the Hall measurement merely measures the carrier density and type, but when the samples' resistivity, $\rho$, is also measured, the carrier mobility can also be found by
\begin{equation}
\mu_H = \frac{R_H}{\rho}.
\end{equation}
In this work, Hall effect measurements were all preceded by a resistivity measurement, and the term "Hall effect measurement" will informally refer to this combined measurement.
Important to note is that the mobility measured by the Hall method can differ from the mobility measured by SE, this is because SE essentially measures how mobile charge carriers are confined to small sample regions, while the Hall method measures the mobility across the whole sample.
Carrier mobility can be impeded by, for example, the presence of grain boundaries, this effect will be measured by the Hall method, while SE probes the mobility within individual grains.
For this reason, the Hall mobilities and optical mobilities will be denoted as $\mu_H$ and $\mu_o$ in this work.

In this work, Hall measurements were performed using a LakeShore \todo{type}, using a van der Pauw geometry.
A magnetic field of 1T was applied, which is the maximum field strength of the setup.
The current ranges for measuring required some fine tuning, with too little current no significant Hall voltages could be measured, while a too high current setting can result in the current source reaching its compliance voltage.
As the resistivity and carrier density can vary by several orders of magnitude, this current tuning ended up taking some trial and error.
To electrically isolate the \AZO{} films from the substrate, substrates with a top layer of 450nm \SiOx{} were used.
While the \AlOx{} capping layer is not conductive, it could easily be pierced by the probe pins, in some cases after applying a gentle force.
Since the van der Pauw geometry uses four-point probing, the contact resistance between the probe pins and the \AZO{} films is irrelevant, but care was taken to ensure that the contacts behave Ohmically, as non-Ohmic behaviour can indicate an improper contact.
**** Contact resistivity
The main contribution of this work is the measurements of contact resistivities of \AZO{} on doped silicon.
These measurements proved very challenging, and this resulted in the design and implementation of a novel contact resistivity measurement.
A full discussion of this method is given in part 2 \todo{reference} of this thesis.
Typical contact resistivity measurements involve controlled patterning and etching steps to achieve a certain contact geometry.
While this can be done with relative ease for some materials, using standard semiconductor fabrication processes, controlled etching of \AZO{} has previously proved itself challenging, due to its high etch rate in most common etchants.
For this reason, typical measurements methods such as the Cox and Strack method (C&S) and the transfer length method (TLM), were not fit for use at the start of this project.
Instead, a simple top-down method was used, in which a current is driven through the contact, and the resulting voltage is measured.
Sadly, this method proved highly unreliable, mainly due to the inhomogeneities in the driven current distributions.
It was found that through more careful electrode design, many of the problems associated with the top-down measurements could be managed.
For this, printed circuit boards were designed and used, featuring sets of interleaved copper electrodes.
Again, this method is detailed in much more detail in Part 2 of this thesis \todo{ref}, but for now, let's focus on the samples that should be used for this method.
With the novel method, the interfacial resistance is not actually measured, but instead, the $V(J)$ behaviour of a sample is obtained.
Assuming linearity here, the resulting resistivity includes contributions from different materials and interfaces.
To give a strict upper bound on the resistivity of the \AZO{}-Si interface, the other contributions need to be minimized.
As the \AlOx{} capping layer is very resistvive, it thus needs to be removed prior to the measurements.
For this purpose, a selective wet etch process was used, which will be discussed in more detail later.
Important is that this selective etch only needs to fully remove the \AlOx{} capping layer while leaving the \AZO{} layer intact, doing this is much easier than patterned etching.


*** \AZO{} ALD process
The \AZO{} deposition process is the same in both sample preparations.
\AZO{} was deposited by ALD using an Oxford Instruments OpAL tool at a temperature of 200\degree{}C.
The films are deposited using diethylzinc (DEZ) and dimethylaluminium isopropoxide (DMAI) in a supercycle process, with water used as a coreactant.
The Al content can be controlled using the number of DEZ cycles per DMAI cycles, which is called the cycle ratio, with for example r16 meaning 16 DEZ cycles per DMAI cycle.
An exception to this naming scheme is intrinsic ZnO, in which no DMAI cycles are used, this is denoted as int.
Note that a high cycle ratio implies a low Al doping.
The used dopings used in this work were int, r96, r48, r24, r16.
The order of the cycles is chosen so that the dopant cycles are evenly spaced, and not at the top or bottom of the film.
r16 then implies 8 cycles of DEZ, 1 cycle of DMAI, followed by 8 cycles DEZ.
This supercycle can then be repeated to obtain the desired film thickness.
**** AlOx capping process
On some samples a 30nm \AlOx{} capping layer was deposited by ALD, this was also done in the OpAL reactor, using only DMAI and water as precursors, again at 200\degree{}C.
In type 1 depositions, the uncapped samples were removed from the reactor between the deposition of \AZO{} and \AlOx{}, venting the reactor.
As it became clear that capping is absolutely crucial to obtain good material properties, all type 2 samples were capped.
**** Anneal
Type 1 samples were successively annealed so that a single sample could be reused at different anneal temperatures.
As a check, pieces of capped r24 \AZO{} were annealed directly to the intended temperature, here little deviation could be found from the successive annealing. \todo{elaborate}
Annealing occured in steps of 50\degree{}C, starting at 200\degree{}C.
To be able to perform the annealing steps quickly in between measurements, the anneals up to 500\degree{}C were performed on a hotplate.
Here a carrier wafer was used to support the samples, which was put on the hotplate and removed after 5 minutes, allowing the samples to cool down again.
As the hotplate's maximum temperature was 500\degree{}C, the anneals up to 700\degree{}C were forming gas anneals done using a Jipelec RTA.
The type 2 samples were directly annealed to the right temperature in the RTA.
**** Type 1
As noted before, the type 1 samples consist simply of a polished silicon wafer with 450nm \SiOx{}.
On this substrate approximately 75nm \AZO{} and optionally 30nm \AlOx{} were deposited by ALD.
For Hall measurements, care was taken to cut off the edges, so that no currents could flow through \AZO{} deposited on the edges and backsides of the samples.
\todo{write part about hall probe piercing \AlOx{} film; probably in Hall section.}

**** Type 2
The type 2 samples are symmetric, featuring a substrate on which films are deposited on both sides.
The used substrates in this work were silicon with 130\Omega and 260\Omega doping profiles. \todo{also include polysilicon?}
Substrate pieces measured approximately 5cm by 5cm, these were put on a carrier wafer and a \AZO{} and \AlOx{} stack was deposited.
In these samples, only 20nm of \AZO{} was deposited.
After the first deposition, the sample was flipped and the recipe was repeated.
In regions with backside deposition, this resulted in the deposition of a \AZO{}/\AlOx{}/\AZO{}/\AlOx{} stack.
The samples were annealed to 400\degree{}C and 500\degree{}C, after which the passivation qualities were measured.
To prepare the samples for contact resistivity measurements, the \AlOx{} capping layer needed to be removed.
For this purpose, an \AlOx{}/\AZO{} selective wet etch was used, which will be discussed in more detail in section \todo{which?}.
In the regions with backside deposition, the process was only able to etch the top layer of \AlOx{}, so a layer of insulating \AlOx{} stayed present between the two \AZO{} films.
After the etch, a 300nm Ag film was deposited by e-beam evaporation using the BVR2008 FC, to enable a good contact for the contact resistivity measurements.
During the first of these measurements, a few of the sample pieces were found to be significantly more resistive than others.
While care had been taken to cleave off the backside deposited regions, it was hypothesized that this was inadequately done, and the partial presence of the \AlOx{} layer influenced the measurements.
This was later confirmed in a TEM study, where an \AlOx{} layer was clearly found between two \AZO{} layers.
To effectively remove the backside deposited regions, it was found useful to mildly scratch these visually recognizable regions before silver evaporation.
After evaporation, the color differences between the \AZO{} and \AZO{}/\AlOx{}/\AZO{} coated regions could of course not be seen, but the scratches remained visible after deposition.
Good samples could then be cleaved from the non-scratched region of the wafer.

*** Hall/SE
# First: look at the sheet resistance, it is immediately clear that this increases drastically while annealing uncapped samples.
# Furthermore, doping decreases the resistance as expected.
# Above 500C anneal temperatures, the resistance drops slightly.
# \todo{look at resistivity instead, trends are comparable}
We start by looking at the resistivity within the \AZO{} films, as measured by the Hall method, these results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:capping_rho}.
Clearly seen is that the uncapped samples deteriorate after even mild annealing, increasing in resistivity by orders of magnitude, this shows that the presence of a capping layer is crucial for achieving good film conductivity.
Also visible is that, unsurprisingly, the resistivity decreases with doping level.
Focusing our attention to the capped samples, the annealing step results in a reduction of resistivity, in some samples up to 50% compared to as-deposited.
For the doped samples a minimum in resistivity is reached around 550\degree{}C to 650\degree{}C, after which an increase is found at 700\degree{}C anneals.
Interestingly, this increase in resistivity at the highest anneal temperatures is not seen in intrinsic ZnO.

#+LABEL: fig:capping_rho
#+CAPTION: \AZO{} resistivity, depending on doping level, capping and annealing temperature. A strong degradation is seen when annealing uncapped samples, indicating that the capping step is crucial. The resistivity decreases with doping level. During annealing of capped samples the resistivity decreases significantly, in some cases being half as resistive as the as-deposited films.
[[./images/rho_vs_acd.png]]

# Question: is this due to carrier mobility or carrier density?
# See Figure \ref{fig:capping_mu_H}
# The mobility of uncapped samples deteriorates strongly upon mild doping, the decrease in resistance for capped samples at 500-550C annealing temperatures is reflected in lowering mobilities.
# Overall, the mobility decreases with doping level, which \question{correct?} could be caused by increased impurity scattering.

These trends can be viewed by the carrier densities and Hall mobilities, which are shown in Figure \ref{fig:capping_n} and Figure \ref{fig:capping_mu_H} respectively.
The deterioration of uncapped films can be attributed to a decrease in both carrier density and Hall mobility.
The decrease in resistivity with doping is found to be attributed to the increased carrier density only, as overall the Hall mobility decreases with doping level.
This decrease in Hall mobility could be caused by increased impurity scattering on Al dopants. \question{doublecheck this.}
For capped samples, annealing at temperatures above 500\degree{}C results in an increased Hall mobility and carrier density, this is potentially caused by an activation of the Al dopants by diffusion.
This diffusion will be discussed in more detail in Section \todo{ref} about the TEM studies performed within this project.

#+LABEL: fig:capping_n_sh
#+CAPTION: Carrier density as function of doping and annealing, the carrier density decays strongly during the annealing of uncapped samples. For capped samples a minimum is seen around 450\degree{}C to 500\degree{}C, after which the carrier density starts increasing. As expected, the carrier density depends strongly on the cycle ratio.

# So far, it is clear that capping is crucial for achieving a low resistivity, the annealing temperature has a less dramatic but significant impact on resistivity, in some samples reducing the resistivity by half.
# Some interesting differences can be seen between intrinsic and doped ZnO at higher anneal temperatures. \todo{discuss somewhere}.
# As expected, the resistivity decreases while increasing the doping level.

Next, let's look at the transparency of the produced films, now focusing only on the capped samples.
As seen in Figure \ref{fig:omega_p}, the plasma frequency depends on the doping level, as was expected.
Furthermore, a small increase is seen at anneal temperatures above 500\degree{}C, this trend stops at higher temperatures for doped samples, but the plasma frequency keeps increasing for intrinsic ZnO, this trend is consistent with the carrier densities found by Hall measurements.

#+LABEL: fig:omega_p
#+CAPTION: Plasma frequency of capped samples as function of annealing temperature and doping.
[[./images/omega_p_vs_anneal.png]]

As shown in Figure \ref{fig:omega_t}, annealing has a more pronounced effect on the scattering frequency.
For doped samples, the scattering frequency decreases at higher annealing temperatures, while it increases for intrinsic ZnO.
This amounts to an increasing optical mobility in doped \AZO{}, while the mobility decreases in intrinsic ZnO.
The cause of these opposing trend is not known.

\todo{plot optische mobiliteit samen met Hall}

Overall, for transparency it is beneficial to use lower doping levels, and to anneal to a sufficient temperature.
While not featured in this work, previously published\cite{maccoAtomiclayerdepositedAldopedZinc2021} passivation results show a maximum in $iV_{oc}$ for annealing temperatures in the 400\degree{}C to 500\degree{}C range.

For these reasons, the choice was made to continue the contact resistivity studies with only capped samples of relatively low doping (int, r96, r48), annealed at 400\degree{}C and 500\degree{}C.
*** Transmission electron microscopy
Notable observations:
- Al diffusion occurs at 600\degree{}C, but not yet at 400\degree{}C
  + 400C shows clear lines with more dopants
  + 600C does not
- This diffusion can account for the increased carrier density, as Al dopants are more active when they are not clustered together in dopant planes.
- ZnO crystal structure continues along dopant planes
- Grain coarsening found at 600C: explains degrading Hall mobility!
- Sanity check: edge deposited \AlOx{} found on 500\degree{}C sample
- Still: what's up with increasing optical mobility?

*** TODO Etch
Look at the etch steps first, verify that they work!
*** Contact resistivity
Measured contact resistivities are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rho_c}.
Some observations \todo{elaborate}:
- Contact resistivities below 100mOhmcm^2 can be obtained! records around 20 mOhmcm^2.
- Contact resistivity increases with anneal temperature, except in intrinsic ZnO.
  This might be caused by Al diffusion, which is seen in TEM images.
- Si doping decreases contact resistivity, previously no good contacts could be made on intrinsic Si \source{is there data showing this?}
- \AZO{} doping seems critical in achieving a low contact resistivity.
  Note: r48 doping is more resistive than r96 on 260 Ohm Si.
  This could be due to the presence of a dopant plane close to the interface, and this has been observed in \source{Niemela et al.}

Finally, we look at the contact resistivities of \AZO{} on n+ diffused silicon.
Measured results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:rho_c}.
It can be seen that low contact resistivities around 20 \mOhmcm{} can be obtained, well below the 100 \mOhmcm{} goal for device fitness.
Moreover, it can be seen that \AZO{} doping is crucial in creating these good contacts, as the undoped ZnO films produce contacts an order of magnitude more resistive.
Interestingly, stronger \AZO{} doping is not necessarily beneficial, as on 260 \Ohmsq{} n+ Si, r48 doped \AZO{} produces more resistive contacts than r96 \AZO{}.
A possible explanation for this effect is the distance of the first Al doping layer from the interface.
In strongly doped \AZO{} this layer is relatively close to the interface, as ZnO initially grows in islands, there is a possibility of depositing \AlOx{} directly on the \SiOx{} if the ZnO islands do not yet fully cover the interface.
\todo{compare with Niemelä}

Recall that previous attempts to create contacts between \AZO{} and intrinsic silicon were not succesful, indicating that this doping is also necessary.

Next, let's consider the impact of the annealing temperature on contact resistivity.
Focusing on samples with doped \AZO{}, annealing at 500\degree{}C can be seen to increase contact resistivity when compared to a milder anneal of 400\degree{}C.
This trend is opposed in intrinsic ZnO samples, for which the resistivity decreases slightly in this range.
The mechanism for this is not precisely known, but it is hypothesized to be caused by diffusion of Al within the \AZO{}, based on the following cues.
In TEM investigations within this project \todo{incorporate}, it was found that Al was more dispersed after a 500\degree{}C anneal than after a 400\degree{}C anneal.
In another study, accumulation of Al was found to occur in polysilicon-\AZO{} interfaces \source{Gerlach}.
Together, the occurence of Al diffusion and its apparent tendency to accumulate at interfaces might be the factors contributing to this increased resistivity.

* Contact resistivity measurements
** Introduction
In the previous part of this thesis, the contact resistivity of Al-doped zinc-oxide on doped silicon was investigated, while omitting details on the performed measurements.
In this part of this thesis, the devised measurement setup and method will be described in full detail.
The method provides an alternative to typical contact resistivity measurements, in which several processing steps are needed to create accurately shaped contacts on the samples of interest.
These methods include the Cox and Strack (C&S) and Transfer Length Method (TLM) methods, which will be explained later.
Not only are these steps time-consuming and complicated to perform, they pose limitations on the types of samples that can be used.
Furthermore, thermal and chemical processing steps could alter the electrical properties of the contact of interest, and there is no guarantee that the tested contacts accurately resemble the contact as it would behave in a practical device.
At the start of this project a simple measurement method was suggested, coat a sample with a thin film of silver, drive a current between the top and bottom of this sample and measure the resulting potential difference.
Multiplying the obtained resistance by the area of the sample should then give the specific resistance of the sample.
While this suggested pin-to-plate measurement is very easy to perform, not needing any patterning and etching steps as required by C&S and TLM, it quickly became clear that the method was so unreliable that useful data could not be obtained.
As the C&S and TLM methods provide some significant challenges, the choice was made to look deeper into the pin-to-plate method, and see if it can be improved on enough to be useful.
This work presents a solution to this problem, in which custom printed circuit boards are used to control the current flow in the samples.
\todo{fill in this part}
The method devised here is able to characterize samples without the need of these patterning steps, requiring only a metallization step to ensure good contacts between the probes and the sample.
** Background
*** COMMENT Contact resistivity
# made this section a comment, still meant for inspiration.
Contacts between different materials often exhibit a voltage drop when a current is applied.
In general, the relation between voltage drop, $V$, and resulting current density, $J$, can be described as
\begin{equation}
J = f(V, \text{other parameters}).
\end{equation}
The other parameters may include, for example, the potential barrier height and doping densities of either material, their roles will be discussed later.
# Will they?
The contact resisivity is then defined as
\begin{equation}
\rho_c = \left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial J}\right\vert_{V = 0},
\end{equation}
in which the dependency on the "other parameters" is implicit.
*** Contact resistivity
# In the previous part of this thesis the contact resistivity of ZnO:Al on silicon was discussed.
# There, several factors that influence contact resistivity were mentioned (COMMENT: such as?) but in all cases the important questions could be phrased as "when a contact is made by process X, how does its current density $J$ depend on the driving voltage $V$?", in which only the process parameters were changed.
In solar cells, contact resistance can be an important loss mechanism, limiting cell efficiency.
As a result, it is an important parameter to minimize.
While the total contact resistance can be defined as $R_c = \frac{V}{I}$, with $V$ and $I$ being the voltage along the contact and the total current respectively, this changes with contact area.
A more useful quantity is the contact resistivity, also known as specific contact resistance, which is area independent.
This $\rho_c$ is defined not using the total current, but the current density $J$:
\begin{equation}
\rho_c = \left.\frac{\partial V}{\partial J}\right\vert_{V = 0}.
\end{equation}
While from a theoretical point of view this description of contacts in terms of $J(V)$ sounds perfectly reasonable, its usage can be challenging in practice.
To understand the problem, consider preparing a sample of area $A$ and assuming that the current is uniformly distributed along the contact.
The definition then easily translates to $\rho_c = \frac{V}{I}A$, where the total current $I$ and induced voltage $V$ can be measured.
In reality, the current distribution into a contact can be localized near the edge of the contact, an effect called current crowding\cite{schroderSolarCellContact1984}.
The current density decays exponentially with characteristic length $L_t = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_c}{R_\square}}$, called the transfer length, here $R_\square$ is the sheet resistance of the wafer.
This phenomenon is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:LtIllustration}.

#+LABEL: fig:LtIllustration
#+CAPTION: Illustration of current crowding along the edge of a contact. The current density $J$ decays exponentially with distance from the contact edge. Shown are a wafer and a contact, current flows into the wafer from the left and into the contact, as indicated by the arrows.
[[./images/Lt_diagram.png]]

This effect will be explained in more detail in Chapter \ref{ch:TheoryChapter}, but first, let's think about its experimental implications.
If the transfer length is much larger than the contacts, then the current will effectively be equally distributed.
Sadly, for the samples used in this work, the transfer length was often found to be smaller than the contact dimensions.
In such cases measuring $V$ and $J$ is not trivial, as they can vary greatly within the contact.
In contrast to these locally defined $V$ and $J$, it is typically only the total current, $I$, and /some/ induced voltage, $V_M$, that can be measured experimentally.
This is the main challenge of contact resistivity measurements: reliably distilling local $J(V)$ behaviour from global $I(V_M)$ measurements.
In the next sections some typical solutions to this challenge will be discussed.
Sadly, most of these methods involve patterning and etching, which, as discussed, can be difficult for ZnO:Al.
\todo{does the next part fit here?}
Within the context of this project, symmetric lifetime samples were often made, consisting of a substrate with ZnO:Al deposited on both sides.
These are further processed by thermal annealing after optional deposition of an \AlOx{} capping layer.
As this capped etching step is one of the focuses of this work, it is desirable to not change this process too much for contact resistivity samples.
This is the main motivation for this part of this thesis, to figure out a way to quantify the contact resistivity of Si-ZnO:Al contacts using the available lifetime samples, without needing to drastically alter them.

*** Typical measurement methods
#+BEGIN_COMMENT
Hier wil ik eigenlijk een beetje terugpakken op hoofdstuk drie van Semiconductor material and device characterization van Schroder.
Het lijkt me een goed idee om van de two-terminal methods een paar te kiezen, zoals transmission line method en Cox & Strack, hoewel er andere varianten bestaan hebben ze allemaal hetzelfde praktische probleem: patterning stappen.
Eigenlijk is de boodschap vooral "two terminal kan, maar je moet sowieso patternen, en interne weerstanden in je meetopstelling kunnen belangrijk zijn".
Daarna wil ik snel door naar de four terminal methodes. Hoofdzakelijk de cross bridge Kelvin resistor (CBKR) setup, maar ook even refereren naar alternatieve opstellingen (Loh et al. - 1985 - 2-D Simulations for accurate extraction ...).
Belangrijke takeaway is hier het belang van de transfer length, en dat zaken makkelijker worden als deze groot is.
Ook belangrijk om het voornaamste probleem te highlighten: scheiding van rho_c en andere termen kan lastig zijn.
#+END_COMMENT
**** Cox and Strack
In the Cox and Strack (C&S) method\cite{schroderDeviceCharacterization} samples are made that feature circular contacts of varying size on one side of the sample, while the other side has a full backplane contact, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:CnSIllustration}.

#+LABEL: fig:CnSIllustration
#+CAPTION: Illustration of a Cox and Strack measurement setup, the ZnO:Al and covering Ag layers are circularly shaped with diameter $d$, the Si and bottom Ag layers are much larger than the circular contact. $t$ indicates the thickness of the Si layer. In practice, a single sample would be covered by multiple dots of varying diameter. The spreading resistance in the silicon scales differently with $d$ than the contact resistance does, so that it can be fit out with sufficient data points.
[[./images/cox_strack.drawio.png]]

The resistance between the backplane and the circular contacts is then measured for the different circular contacts.
The main assumption here is that the total resistance can be described as a sum of three resistances: contact resistance $R_c$, spreading resistance $R_s$, and some fixed residual resistance $R_0$.
Cox and Strack originally modeled these terms as
\begin{equation}
R_{T} \approx \underbrace{\frac{\rho_W}{\pi d}\arctan\left(\frac{4t}{d}\right)}_{R_s} + \underbrace{\frac{\rho_c}{\frac{1}{4}\pi d^2}}_{R_c} + R_0,
\end{equation}
where $d$ is the diameter of the contact, $\rho_W$ is the wafer resistivity, $\rho_c$ the contact resistivity and $t$ is the thickness of the wafer \cite{coxOhmicContactsGaAs1967}.
Since the contact and spreading resistances depend differently on the contact radius, the contact resistivity can be determined by varying $d$ and fitting to the model.
While more accurate models for the resistance terms have been found \cite{vanrijnbachAccuracyCoxStrack2020,ahmadDeterminationContactResistivity1995}, the concept behind the measurement stays the same.
The practical implications of this method are that samples have to be precisely made, the circular contacts are typically tens of micrometers in radius. \todo{source, this depends on resistances, how?}
To make structures like this one would need to remove part of the contacting layer, this extra processing, as explained previously, is best avoided.
\todo{what measurement range?}

**** Transfer length method
The transfer length method (TLM) somewhat resembles the C&S method in the sense that multiple sample geometries are used to fit out the contact resistivity.
In TLM, the chosen geometry can be either linear or circular \todo{cite}, these variants are conceptually similar, so only the linear variant is discussed here.
A linear TLM setup is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:TLMIllustration}.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+LABEL: fig:TLMIllustration
#+CAPTION: Side view illustration of a TLM measurement setup, on a rectangular sample of width $W$ (not shown) several rectangular contacts are made, two shown here. The distance $L$ between the contacts is varied. Note that the current is not uniformly distributed over the contact, but is localized within a transfer length $L_t$.
[[./images/TLM_drawing.drawio.png]]

In this setup the total resistance consists of twice the contact resistance $R_c$ and the resistance of the Si wafer $R_w$.
The wafer resistance can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
R_w = \frac{L \Rsq}{W},
\end{equation}
in which $W$ is the width of the sample and $\Rsq$ is the sheet resistance of the wafer.

Through current crowding, the currents are effectively localized to within a transfer length $L_t = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_c}{\Rsq}}$ of the contact edge, this length will be derived in Chapter \ref{ch:TheoryChapter}.
This current crowding implies that the contact has an effective area of $WL_t$.
Now take for the contact resistance $R_c = \frac{\rho_c}{WL_t} = \frac{R_\square L_t}{W}$, where the definition of $L_t$ was used to obtain the second expression.
Now the total resistance can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
R_T = 2\underbrace{\frac{R_\square L_t}{W}}_{R_c} + \underbrace{\frac{LR_\square}{W}}_{R_w} = \frac{R_\square}{W}(2L_t + L).
\end{equation}
Here, the horizontal and vertical intercepts signify twice the transfer length and twice the contact resistance respectively, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:TLMGraph}.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+LABEL: fig:TLMGraph
#+CAPTION: Example of a TLM analysis, the red fit line intercepts the horizontal axis at $-2L_t$ and the vertical axis at $2R_c$.
[[./images/TLM_graph.png]]

After finding the intercepts, the specific contact resistivity can be found as $\rho_c = R_c L_t W$ \todo{source}.

The drawbacks of this method are similar to those of the C&S method, patterning and etching steps are required, making TLM not only difficult, but also possibly undermining the validity of the obtained results.
Again, the ZnO:Al film should be partially removed in a controlled way, which is best avoided.
A difference with the C&S method is that TLM samples imply symmetric measurements of a contact, in Ohmic contacts this is not an issue, but since in TLM the contacts are always in an antiseries configuration, this can make non-Ohmic contacts difficult to characterize.
**** Cross bridge Kelvin resistor
While the previously described methods rely on being able to fit out the contact resistivity from some set of measurements, the cross bridge Kelvin resistor (CBKR) method takes a different approach.
In essence the method is a top-down four-terminal measurement, a current is driven from the top to the bottom of a sample using two terminals, while two other terminals are used to measure the resulting voltage.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+LABEL: fig:CBKRIllustration
#+CAPTION: Illustration of a CBKR setup, shown are two L-shaped electrodes with a sample located in between. The electrodes are not in direct contact with each other. A current is driven from one of the legs of an L, through the sample, through the opposing leg of the other L. Meanwhile the resulting voltage is measured along the remaining legs. Also shown is a misalignment between the edges of the sample and the edges of the electrodes, this should ideally be small.
[[./images/CBKR_drawing.png]]

These electrodes are formed as two L-shapes, one on either side of the sample, with the "legs" opposed to each other.
One set of opposed legs is used to drive the current, while the other opposed set is used to measure the voltage.
With this approach parasitic resistances are easily ignored, as the voltage measuring wires carry no current.

Measure the total resistance of the sample, and multiply this by its area to get the /measured/ specific resistance,
\begin{equation}
\rho_M \equiv \frac{V_\text{meas}}{I_\text{src}} A,
\end{equation}
ideally this should equal the specific resistance, $\rho_c$, of the sample, but this relies on some assumptions that will be checked next.
# While the method might sound very simple, just drive a current and measure /the/ voltage, a possible challenge lies in the basic assumption that the current is evenly distributed over the sample, or equivalently, that the contacting electrodes form isopotentials.
One of there assumptions is that the current is evenly distributed over the sample, or equivalently, that the contacting electrodes form isopotentials.
When measuring samples with low specific resistivities this might not hold, currents can be localized near the edge of the sample, and the measured voltage might not accurately represent the average voltage across the sample.
Additionally, misaligned contacts can result in currents "wrapping around" the sample, this can result in an overestimation of the average voltage over the sample.
\todo{illustrate wrap-around}
# TODO source, probably Schreyer&Saraswat
This effect was modeled by Schreyer and Saraswat \cite{schreyerTwodimensionalAnalyticalModel1986a}, defining the measured contact resistivity $\rho_M$ as the product of measured resistance and sample area, and the transfer length $L_t$ as $\sqrt{\frac{\rho_c}{R_\square}}$, their main result can be expressed as,
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:CBKRError}
\frac{\rho_M}{\rho_c} = 1 + \underbrace{\frac{4}{3}\frac{\delta^2}{W_x W_y}\frac{A}{L_t^2}\left[1 + \frac{\delta}{2(W_x - \delta)}\right]}_{C_g},
\end{equation}
in which $\delta$ is the sample misalignment, and $W_x$ and $W_y$ are the thicknesses of the legs of the electrodes.
Here the second term is referred to as the geometric correction factor, or $C_g$.
Ideally $C_g$ is small, so that $\rho_M \approx \rho_c$, this can be realized by using small samples, small misalignments, and highly conductive electrodes.
Luckily $C_g$ can easily be estimated.
# For example, consider making a rudimentary CBKR structure using household aluminium foil.
\todo{how does next section fit here?}
Taking $\rho_c \approx 10\text{m}\Omega\text{cm}^2$ as a lower bound, and suppose using pieces of household aluminium foil for contacts ($R_\square \approx 3\text{m}\Omega_\square$, measured with a four-point probe), this gives a worst case (i.e. shortest) transfer length of around 2 cm.
For easy measurements, the needed samples should not be much smaller than a squared cm, otherwise they will be difficult to cleave and handle with tweezers.
By cutting the foil carefully, electrodes can be made with an estimated misalignment of around one mm.
Substitution yields a $C_g$ on the order of magnitude of a few thousandth's, indicating that geometric effects will not be significant in this setup.

In contrast to TLM and the C&S method, no patterning and etching steps are required by the CBKR method, making it a viable option for ZnO:Al samples.
Still, there are some practical drawbacks to this method regarding the fabrication of test structures.
In practice it can be difficult to cleave samples to specified dimensions, so that electrodes need to be custom made for each sample piece to reduce misalignment.
Additionally, making sure that there are no shorts between the flimsy pieces of aluminium foil can be challenging.
Experience shows that strategically placed pieces of insulating tape can help, but in the end eyebrows will probably be raised when reading "we sandwiched the sample between some household foil and duct tape, and it just appeared to work" in the methods section of any report.
Despite these drawbacks, by working carefully it is possible to make these structures from aluminium foil.
Due to its compatibility with the ZnO:Al samples, the CBKR method can be used as a good sanity check for any new measurements of these samples.
\todo{measurement limits}.

**** Pin to plate
The challenges of measuring contact resistivities of ZnO:Al films were known at the start of this project, previous experience showed that reliable patterning and etching of this material is difficult, making TLM and the C&S method impractical.
The approach that had been used to far was to clamp samples between a copper plate and some of the probe pins of the already available four point probe setup, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:PtPIllustration}.
One of the probe pins would be used to drive a current to the plate, while another pin would be used to measure the voltage across the sample.
The copper plate would serve as both a current driving electrode and a reference voltage since, due to its high conductivity, the electric fields within the plate can be assumed to be negligible.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.7\textwidth
#+LABEL: fig:PtPIllustration
#+CAPTION: Illustration of a pin to plate measurement, featuring a copper base plate on which a silver coated sample is located. A current is driven between a pin and the base plate, while the voltage between another pin and the base plate is measured.
[[./images/pin_plate_drawing.drawio.png]]

In essence this method is somewhat similar to the CBKR method, where a current is driven through the sample, /the/ resulting voltage is measured, and the resulting resistance is multiplied by sample area to get the specific resistivity.
While in the CBKR method the average voltage along the sample is measured (neglecting geometric resistance), in the pin to plate method the relation between measured voltage and average voltage is not so clear.
Due to the contacting geometry, the voltage in the top contact is highly nonuniform, so that the measured voltage can differ by orders of magnitude on a single sample, depending on where this voltage is measured.
These inhomogeneities will be analyzed in detail in Chapter \ref{ch:TheoryChapter}.

It quickly became clear that this method provided neither reliable nor valid results, since measurements on exactly the same sample could yield values that vary by orders of magnitude.
Nonetheless, the extreme ease of measurement compared to the previously discussed measurement methods made it an interesting candidate for further investigation.
If the poorly chosen probing geometry is the cause of the problematic voltage nonuniformities, then maybe a different choice of probing geometry could solve this problem.

Addressing these challenges in the pin to plate method is the goal of the rest of this thesis.
The first step is to better understand the nature of current (or equivalently, voltage, by Ohm's law) inhomogeneities, this will be the goal of Chapter \ref{ch:TheoryChapter}.
# What causes these inhomogeneities? Does this depend on geometry, physical properties of the samples, or maybe something else? Can these effects be fit out, like in TLM or the C&S method? Can they be neglected by a proper choice of electrode materials, like in the CBKR method?
# In Chapter \ref{ch:TheoryChapter} these questions will be addressed, and

*** COMMENT Wiskunde achter spreiding: transfer length
Dit vind ik een lastige qua plek, enerzijds zou ik hem voor de "typical measurement methods" kwijt willen, maar een lezer die niet bekend is met de werking van de methodes heeft er waarschijnlijk nog niet gek veel aan. Het lijkt me een beter plan om eerst een paar praktische situaties te omschrijven, zoals spreiding in C&S, CBKR en TLM, om er naderhand verklarend op terug te komen met de transfer length, en de algemene rol die deze heeft in dit soort metingen.
*** Transfer length effects
So far, all the top-down measurement methods had to mitigate one phenomenon, transfer length effects.
Consider ideal conductors used as contacts, as these form regions of equal electric potential, the potential difference between top and bottom of the sample will be equal everywhere.
The driven current density will be uniform, found simply by: $J = \frac{\Delta V}{\rho_s}$.
In this idealized case, contact resistivities would be trivial to measure, but in reality the driven current distributions and potential differences can be significantly inhomogeneous, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:inhomogeneityIllustration}.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth
#+CAPTION: A comparison between contacting with ideally conducting electrodes (top) and electrodes with significant resistivity (bottom). Positive and negative voltages are shown as shades of red and blue in the electrodes, while the current density through the sample is depicted using arrows and shades of yellow. In the ideal case the contact voltages and current densities are uniform, while in the non-ideal case the current distribution is localized near the current injection point of the contacting electrodes.
#+LABEL: fig:inhomogeneityIllustration
[[./images/current_homogeneity.drawio.png]]

To quantify these effects, the interaction between electrodes and sample was modeled, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:lengthIllustration}.
# Here a slab of material is shown laying in the $xy$ -plane \todo{typesetting}, the slab consists of a substrate with a conductive layer on either side.
# The potentials within these layers are indicated by $V_{top}$ and $V_{bottom}$ respectively.
# Currents can flow within the contacts, as indicated by $J_{top}$ and $J_{bottom}$, but also through the contact, as indicated by $J_\perp$.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 0.9\textwidth
#+CAPTION: A model of a sample with two contacting electrodes. In the electrodes the current density is determined from the electrodes' conductivity and the electric fields. The current density through the sample can be determined from the stack resistivity $\rho$ and the local potential difference between the top and bottom electrode.
#+LABEL: fig:lengthIllustration
[[./images/length_diagram_new.png]]

**** Governing equations
In this model an arbitrary slab of sample and electrodes is considered, oriented along the x-y plane, with the z-direction defining the top and bottom of the setup.
The electrodes are considered to be very thin, and relatively conductive, so that the voltage within each electrode is independent of $z$.
Within these electrodes, the current density is determined by Ohm's law, so that
\begin{equation}
\vec{J}_{top} = -\sigma\nabla_{(x,y)} V_{top}(x,y),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\vec{J}_{bottom} = -\sigma\nabla_{(x,y)} V_{bottom}(x,y),
\end{equation}
in which $\sigma$ is the conductivity of the electrode material.
The current density through the sample is given by
\begin{equation}
J_\perp = \frac{V_{top} - V_{bottom}}{\rho},
\end{equation}
for some specific sample resistance $\rho$.
Consider charge conservation in any region $\Omega$ in the top electrode, which can be expressed as a sum of currents flowing into the region from other parts of the electrodes, and a current flowing into the sample:
\begin{equation}
0 = \int_\Omega \vec{J}\cdot\vec{\mathrm{d}A} = \int_\Omega J_\perp \mathrm{d}A + \oint_{\partial\Omega}\vec{J}_{top}\cdot\hat{n}h\mathrm{d}s,
\end{equation}
where $h$ is the thickness of the electrode.
Substitution of the current densities followed by application of the divergence theorem yields
\begin{equation}
0 = \int_\Omega \frac{1}{\rho}(V_{top} - V_{bottom}) \mathrm{d}A - \int_\Omega \sigma h \nabla^2_{(x,y)}V_{top}\mathrm{d}A,
\end{equation}
and similarly for the bottom equation, except the sign of the $J_\perp$ contribution is switched
\begin{equation}
0 = \int_\Omega \frac{1}{\rho}(V_{top} - V_{bottom}) \mathrm{d}A + \int_\Omega \sigma h \nabla^2_{(x,y)}V_{bottom}\mathrm{d}A.
\end{equation}
Adding the two together, and letting $\phi \equiv V_{top} - V_{bottom}$, one gets
\begin{equation}
0 = \int_\Omega -\sigma h\nabla^2_{(x,y)}\phi + \frac{\phi}{\rho}\mathrm{d}A
\end{equation}
As the choice of $\Omega$ was arbitrary, the integrand must vanish almost everywhere, so that
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \phi
= \frac{1}{\sigma h \rho}\phi
= \frac{\Rsq}{\rho}\phi,
\end{equation}
where $\frac{1}{\sigma h}$ is recognized as the sheet resistance $\Rsq$.

No PDE is complete without appropriate boundary conditions, in this work Neumann boundary conditions are considered, as these describe four-point probing setups the best: a current distribution is driven along some part of the domain boundary, and some resulting potential difference is measured.
In dimensionless form, the equation can be written as
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\nabla}^2 \phi = \left(\frac{L}{L_t}\right)^2 \phi \equiv k^2\phi,
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the characteristic dimension of the sample, and $L_t \equiv \sqrt{\frac{\rho}{R_{sq}}}$ is the familiar transfer length, and the dimensionless Laplacian is given by $\tilde{\nabla}^2 = \frac{1}{L^2}\nabla^2$.
In following sections the tilde on the Laplacian will be omitted, so that the dimensionless form of the PDE is given by
\begin{align}
\label{eq:modelDefDomain}
\nabla^2\phi &= k^2\phi, &\text{Contact}\\
\label{eq:modelDefBC}
\nabla\phi\cdot \hat{n} &= f  &\text{Contact edge}.
\end{align}
**** Uniqueness of solutions
To show that solutions are unique, consider two solutions, $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ and let $\hat\phi \equiv \phi_1 - \phi_2$, the goal will be to show that the PDE and boundary conditions force $\phi$ to vanish.
Linearity shows that $\hat\phi$ must obey
\begin{align}
\nabla^2\hat\phi &= k^2\hat\phi, \quad \Omega\\
\nabla\hat\phi\cdot \hat{n} &= 0 \quad \partial\Omega.
\end{align}
Now consider the following integral,
\begin{equation}
\int_\Omega \nabla \cdot(\hat\phi\nabla\hat\phi) \mathrm{d}x= \oint_{\partial\Omega}\hat\phi\nabla\hat\phi\cdot\vec{\mathrm{d}A} \overset{\mathrm{B.C.}}{=} 0,
\end{equation}
apply the chain rule
\begin{equation}
0=\int_\Omega \nabla\cdot(\hat\phi\nabla\hat\phi)\mathrm{d}x = \int_\Omega\hat\phi\nabla^2\hat\phi + \nabla\hat\phi\cdot\nabla\hat\phi\mathrm{d}x,
\end{equation}
and apply the PDE to clear the $\nabla^2\hat\phi$ term,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:unicityInnerProduct}
0 = \int_\Omega k^2\hat\phi^2 + \left|\nabla\hat\phi\right|^2\mathrm{d}x.
\end{equation}
With the inner product
\begin{equation}
\langle\phi,\psi\rangle \equiv \int_\Omega k\phi\psi + \nabla\phi\cdot\nabla\psi \mathrm{d}x,
\end{equation}
Equation \ref{eq:unicityInnerProduct} can be recognized as $\langle\hat\phi,\hat\phi\rangle = 0$, so that $V_{top} - V_{bottom} \equiv \phi = 0$, proving that solutions of Equations \ref{eq:modelDefDomain} and \ref{eq:modelDefBC} are indeed unique.
**** Influence of transfer length
Now, let's apply this model to a few practical situations, starting with a pin to plate measurement.
For simplicity, the samples are modeled as circular with radius $1$, excluding the origin.
Through an appropriate choice of $k$ the solutions can describe any arbitrary combination of sample radius, contact resistivity and sheet resistance.
As all currents are contained in the sample, the current density must vanish at the boundary, so that $\phi'(1) = 0$.
The origin is excluded from the domain, so that a current source can be located here.
In experimental conditions the total supplied current, $I$, is known.
In this model however the average potential drop, $\bar{\phi}$, is specified, so that
\begin{equation}
\bar{\phi} = \frac{\int_\Omega \phi\mathrm{d}A}{\int_\Omega \mathrm{d}A} = \frac{2\pi}{\pi R^2}\int_0^1r\phi(r)\mathrm{d}r = 2\int_0^1r\phi(r)\mathrm{d}r.
\end{equation}
Since we're interested in deviations from the average potential, the average potential is fixed at a dimensionless value of $1$.
In the adopted cylindrical coordinates, the PDE can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
r^2\phi''(r) + r\phi'(r) - r^2 k^2 \phi(r) = 0,
\end{equation}
which is known as the modified Bessel equation.
This modified Bessel function has solutions:
\begin{equation}
\phi(r) = AI_0(kr) + BK_0(kr),
\end{equation}
in which $A$ and $B$ are integration constants and $I_0$ and $K_0$ are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind \cite{abramowitzHandbookMathematicalFunctions1964}.
By applying the boundary and integral conditions the integration constants can be found.
These steps are omitted here, as it is mostly textbook linear algebra.
In a simpler 1D cartesian system, the PDE reduces to $\phi'' = k^2\phi$, which was solved with a similar boundary and integral condition.
The solutions for both geometries and varying $k$ are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutions}.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\textwidth
#+CAPTION: A comparison of solutions for $\phi$ on $(0,1]$ in Cartesian and cylindrical coordinates, for varying $k \equiv \frac{L}{L_t}$. With boundary condition $\phi'(1) = 0$ and integral condition $\bar\phi = 1$. Note that the cylindrical solutions have much steeper gradients than the Cartesian ones, and that the homogeneity of the current distribution depends strongly on $k$, with large $k$ leading to very inhomogeneous currents. \todo{capitalize cylindrical}
#+LABEL: fig:phiSolutions
[[./images/phi_solutions.png]]

Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutions} clearly shows the impact of the transfer length on the homogeneity of the current distribution, short transfer lengths (compared to sample dimensions) result in very inhomogeneous current distributions.
Additionally, when compared at similar transfer lengths, the cylindrical solutions are much less homogeneous than the cartesian ones.

*** Idea: reduce effective sample dimensions
Suppose you were to conduct a four-point probing experiment in either geometry, in which a current is driven through the sample, and some potential difference between the top and bottom of the sample, $\phi_M$, is measured.
What would be a good way to perform these measurements?

To answer this question, it is useful to first estimate $L_t$ for the samples of interest.
As the current distribution is least homogeneous for small $L_t$, it is safest to underestimate it by using large sheet resistivities and low stack resistivities.
While the stack resistivity is of course not known before the measurements, the lowest order of magnitude of $\rho$ was estimated at 10 m\Omega{}cm^2, while for the used AZO films, $R_{sq} \approx 100$ \Omega{} is not uncommon, in this case the transfer length is on the order of 0.1 mm. \question{is meer toelichting nodig?}

In practice, we'd like to be able to work with samples with dimensions of at least a few mm, not just because these are easier to handle, but because these can be easily be prepared by hand-cleaving a bigger sample piece.
In these cases $k$ would be significantly larger than 1, so the majority of current will be driven only through a small part of the sample near the current drive electrode.

The goal now is to reduce $k$ through some means, in the ideal limiting case $k = 0$, but how close is close enough?
In Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutionsEdge}, the normalized (with respect to the average) value of \phi is shown at the extremes of a sample for different $k$, the black horizontal line indicates 99%.
This shows that, in order to measure the average potential to within a percent relative error, $k$ has to be around 0.25 or lower.

#+ATTR_LATEX: :placement [!htb] :width 1\textwidth
#+CAPTION: $\frac{\phi_M}{\bar\phi}$ at the edge of the sample, as function of $\frac{L}{L_t}$. For small $\frac{L}{L_t}$ the potential measured at the edge very closely resembles the average potential.
#+LABEL: fig:phiSolutionsEdge
[[./images/phi_solutions_edge.png]]

To realize this goal of decreasing $\frac{L}{L_t}$, two separate approaches are combined.
The first is to increase $L_t$ by making the contacting layers more conductive, this is achieved by depositing 300 nm of silver by e-beam evaporation.
This increases $L_t$ to approximately a few millimeters. \question{meer toelichting nodig?}
# hoe kom ik hier aan?
The second approach is to effectively reduce $L$ by controlling the probe geometry.
At first glance, $L$ appears to be determined by the sample size, a current is driven through some point, and this current cannot flow out of the sample, represented in the boundary condition $\phi'(L) = 0$.
An obvious option to reduce $L$ could be to simply cut smaller samples, but in the millimeter range this is difficult, especially when areas need to be accurately determined.
Working with tiny samples, while perfectly fine in theory, is undesired in practice, so can we decrease $L$ in bigger samples? The answer is yes!
The trick lies in the nature of the boundary condition, it is only required that $\phi'(L) = 0$, but does this imply that the sample is contained in the $0 < x < L$ range? Not neccesarily.
As an example, consider the one dimensional case: $\phi''(x) = k^2\phi(x)$ on $(0,1)$.
Now instead of applying a zero flux condition at any domain edge, simply consider solutions that are symmetric around $x = \frac{1}{2}$.
These can easily be constructed from the solutions, $\phi_k(x)$, as

\begin{equation}
\phi_{k,\mathrm{sym}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(\phi_k(x) + \phi_k(1-x)).
\end{equation}

These solutions correspond to a current being injected through two separate contacts, located at $x = 0$ and $x=1$.

Symmetric solutions are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutionsSym}, it is clear that now $\phi'(\frac{1}{2}) = 0$.
Notice the similarity between the solutions as shown in Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutions} and the left half of Figure \ref{fig:phiSolutionsSym}, they are the same!
Apparently driving currents with a grid of symmetric electrodes will let us effectively change $L$. \question{is dit argument duidelijk?}

#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 1\textwidth
#+CAPTION: Symmetric solutions to Equation \ref{eq:modelDefDomain} in a 1D Cartesian geometry. Note that $\phi' = 0$ halfway between the two contacts, in this case the boundary conditions are imposed through the contact spacing, not through the total dimensions of the sample.

**** TODOS :noexport:
***** TODO Generalization to what?
Weird wording, fix this
** New approach
This approach was realized using custom made printed circuit boards (PCBs), as shown in Figure \ref{fig:PCBimage}.
The PCBs feature a pad of regularly spaced copper lines, covering an area of 15 by 15 mm^2.
The copper lines are alternately connected to either of the shown pins, so that they resemble interleaved combs.
To perform a measurement, a sample is clamped between two such PCBs, and a current is driven between two combs on alternate sides of the sample, while the other combs are used to measure the resulting potential across the sample in a four-terminal configuration.
The used copper lines were 0.6 mm wide and spaced 0.3 mm apart, with this spacing and a sample spreading length on the order of half a cm, the requirement that $\frac{L}{L_t} < 0.25$ is easily met, so that the current distribution can be considered homogeneous.

Practically, the measurements come down to the following steps:

#+LATEX: \noindent\fbox{
#+LATEX: \parbox{\textwidth}{%
1) Create samples that:
   - Have a spreading length significantly larger than the distance between the fingers of the PCBs to be used. Cover with silver if neccesary.
   - Are homogeneous, this might not be the case when deposited films wrap around the samples.
   - Feature no edge deposited conductive films, it is recommended to cleave off the edges of the samples after silver deposition.
   - Have an accurately known surface area, $A$, in this work this was achieved with a computer vision method, which will be discussed later. \todo{describe script in appendix}
   - Fit on the 15 mm by 15 mm measurement pads of the PCBs.
2) Set up the resistance measurement system:
   - Use a sourcemeter in a four-terminal sensing configuration, in this work a Keithley 2400 was used.
   - Connect the current source terminals of the sourcemeter to "combs" on the two separate PCBs.
   - Connect the voltage measurement terminals to the remaining combs.
3) Clamp the sample between the PCBs
   - Make sure that the sample is located on the pads, and does not shift before measuring.
   - Use the alignment holes of the PCBs for consistent alignment.
   - Apply an evenly distributed pressure to the sample, this can be achieved with a glue clamp.
4) Perform a standard four-terminal resistance measurement, yielding resistance $R$.
5) Calculate the specific resistivity $\rho_s = R\cdot A$.

\todo{include figure of wiring}

The interpretation of the measured stack resistivity depends on the used samples, as in this work symmetric samples were used, the stack resistivity must be larger than twice the interfacial resistivity of the AZO-Si interface.
In this case an upper bound on contact resistivity can be given as $\rho_c < \frac{1}{2}\rho_s$.

** Characterization of measurement method
So far the case for PCB measurements has boiled down on purely theoretical arguments, in the following chapters the measurement method will be experimentally characterized.
The characterization will focus on two desired properties of the new measurement: reliability and validity.
A measurement method is reliable when it is reproducible, yielding the same results on each measurement.
Reliability by itself is not enough though, simply because observations being close to each other does not imply that they are close to the /correct/ value.
A measurement is called valid if its results actually resemble what is *intended* to be measured.
For a good measurement system these two qualities obviously go hand in hand.

While the reliability often refers to repeated measurements under the exact same conditions, this strict definition is not very useful when considering the PCB measurements, as the goal is to reliably measure the contact resistivity *without* regard to some sample handling details.
For context, the initial measurement system (TODO footnote: detail pin to plate) proved quite reliable when a single sample was contacted and stayed fixed between measurements.
Problems started appearing however, as soon as this sample was contacted with different pins, in slightly different locations, rotated a bit, or a different sample piece was used.
The estimated contact resistivities varied unpredictably when even slight, to the user practically unnoticeable, changes were made to the setup.
The goal here is not to be reliable under strict control of all influencing factors, but to be reliable in a somewhat chaotic environment, one in which the user can choose not to care about the exact shape and contacting points of their samples, and still get /reliable/ results.
For this reason, the term reliability is used in a looser sense in this work: a measurement is considered reliable when it yields similar (enough) results in a range of realistic usage scenarios.

More practically speaking, these "realistic usage scenarios" should at least include different contacting conditions, like where the sample is located and in which orientation, but also simply using another sample of differing dimensions.
These reliability experiments were done by varying exactly the mentioned conditions and measuring if these influence the measurement, this will be discussed in more detail in following sections.

To check the validity of the measurement, a reference measurement is needed.
Ideally a sample with a well known specific resistance could be used, but these were not available.
Another option is to take a sample, measure the specific resistance through some other means, and then compare the results with the new method.
This concurrent validity test was chosen, in which the novel method was compared to a cross bridge kelvin resistor (CBKR).
The choice for a CBKR test was made since it can handle the same type of samples that the PCBs can.
The needed patterning for Cox & Strack and other methods would imply the need to make separate samples, process them differently, and just hope that they have the same specific resistance.
A CBKR allows for measurements on the exact same samples as on the PCBs, without any alterations, making it fit for a direct comparison of measurement methods.
The used CBKR setup will be discussed in more detail in Section \ref{sec:CBKRResults}.

*** TODOS :noexport:
**** DONE Why check validity/reliability?
Because method has only been discussed theoretically, a proper assessment is needed in practice
***** DONE Contrast reliability validity
Reliability indicates how closely the measurements are spaced.
Validity indicates the error between measurement and actual value.
Both are needed for a proper measurement.
Reliability can be assessed using just the PCBs, for validity at least one secondary method is required for calibration.
**** TODO How will I check if the method works?
***** TODO Check reliability with PCBs
As discussed before, the reliability can be assessed using just the PCBs, but how?
Ideally this method is "hufter-proof", in the sense that it doesn't matter where the sample is exactly, as long as you know its area.
First, the placement invarance is tackled in two steps: first the rotation (in?)variance, second the translation (in?)variance.
After that, the sample area dependence is checked.
****** TODO Is the measurement invariant in rotations?
A few rectangular samples were selected (why these? basically arbitrary...)
For these, measurements were conducted in either orientation, with the long side parallel to the fingers and with the short side parallel to the fingers.
To probe the per-measurement variance, measurements were conducted five times per orientation.
(hint: does not matter much, you can mostly forget about it!)
****** TODO Is the measurement invariant in translations?
Next, the influence of the position of the sample on measured \rho was checked.
Here the samples were located at each extreme of the PCB, i.e. top-right, top-left, etc.. and in the center.
This was done for a few samples, including those used in the rotation experiment, again multiple times.
****** TODO Is the measurement invariant in sample area?
Out of each sample wafer, different sample pieces were cut.
A possible limitation of this method is that inhomogeneous processing such as localized backside deposition can effect in differences in overall sample resistivity.
As it is difficult to cut out samples of specific sizes, wafer pieces are ranked by overall dimensions, with piece A being larger than piece B, and piece B being larger than piece C.
These measurements were also performed on the five different positions noted in the translation invariance experiment, so that the resulting data can be used for either experiment.
***** TODO Check validity with CBKR
While the reliability can be assessed using just the PCB method itself, an extra calibration in needed to assess the validity of the method.
For this a Cross Bridge Kelvin Resistor setup was devised out of aluminium foil.
A few samples were probed with the PCBs and the CBKR setup, measuring multiple times to obtain decent statistics.
Ideally the results match for both measurement methods.
****** TODO How were CBKR experiments conducted?
Cut out of aluminium foil.
****** TODO Do the results match with the PCB method?

** Results
*** Reliability
Ideally the PCB method should yield the same contact resistivities, regardless of
- Sample orientation,
- Sample position,
- Sample shape.
These assumptions were checked, starting with the sample orientation.
Here the contact resistivity was measured for two cases, in the "long" case the long edge of the sample was aligned parallel to the fingers of the PCBs, while in the "short" case the short edge was aligned parallel to the fingers.
This was done for two symmetric samples:
1) pSi substrate with r48 AZO annealed at 400C, measuring approx 4.5 mm by 6.5 mm.
2) 130 \Omega n+ Si with r48 AZO annealed at 400C, measuring approx 6.5 mm by 9.0 mm.

The results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:PCBOrientation}.
For the pSi sample, the results are quite consistent, while for the n+ Si sample there is more spreading in the measurements.
This can be explained by the pSi sample having a larger contact resistivity than the n+ Si sample, and thus a larger spreading length, this sample also happened to have smaller dimensions, so that overall the current distribution can be expected to be more homogeneous.
Overall, the measurement seems most repeatable in the "short" configuration.

#+CAPTION: Measured contact resistivities with varying orientation. Two different samples were used, for which the contact resistivity was measured in different orientations. In the "short" cases, when the short side of the sample lies parallel to the PCB's fingers, the measurements are most reliable.
#+LABEL: fig:PCBOrientation
[[./images/measurement_orientation.png]]

Next the location of the sample on the PCB was varied for a few samples. The samples were located at all four extreme corners of the PCB pad and at the center.
Figure \ref{fig:PCBPiece} shows the measured results for each of the tested samples, note the logarithmic vertical axis.
This shows that the measurement is typically reliable on a per-sample basis.
There are some clear deviations between pieces cut out of the same wafer, while these should all have the same contact resistivities, Figure \ref{fig:PCBPiece} shows that this is not the case.
A possible cause for this is backside deposition of \AlOx{} resulting in nonuniform samples, which was observed to occur by TEM. \todo{reference to figure}
\todo{how does this influence $\rho_c$, why is it expected to increase?}

Hoe komt dit? Deels backside depo, iig niet uit te sluiten, ervaring: backside depo goed weg snijden geeft vergelijkbare data. Deze dataset moet ik nog even goed bij elkaar sprokkelen...

*** Validity: Cross Bridge Kelvin Resistor comparison
\label{sec:CBKRResults}
Finally the PCB method was cross-validated with a Cross Bridge Kelvin Resistor (CBKR) setup which was carefully crafted from pieces of aluminium foil.
While this alternate method is difficult and time consuming to perform, it provides a good sanity check for the PCB method.
To do this, two L-shaped pieces of aluminium foil were cut, with the widths of the legs matching the dimensions of the samples.
These contacting pads were made for each specific sample.
Then the sample was clamped between the pieces of foil, while pieces of insulating tape ensured that no shorts could occur between the contacting pads.
Two opposing "legs" were used to drive a current, while the potential difference was measured between the others, again in a four-point probe configuration.
Several samples were used, for which the contact resistivity was measured multiple times with the PCB method and the CBKR method, Figure \ref{fig:CBKRvsPCB} shows that the results correlate strongly, here the error bars show the minimal and maximal values for each measurement.

#+CAPTION: Comparison between PCB measurements and and CBKR measurements on a set of samples, the error bars indicate the minimum and maximum of the measured values. Ideally the measurements should match exactly, which is indicated by the black line.

** Conclusion
A method for easy contact resistivity measurements on laterally uniform samples was developed.
This was achieved by contacting samples with custom made printed circuit boards, featuring interleaved comb-like copper contacts, which are used to drive a uniform current distribution through a sample.
In contrast to the Cox & Strack and transmission line methods, which involve delicate sample patterning steps, the method developed here only requires uniform conductive contacting layers.
This is especially important for ZnO:Al samples, since controlled etching of these layers is known to be difficult, rendering TLM and the C&S method impractical.
In essence, the new method shows similarities to the CBKR method, both methods use a four terminal approach, and both aim to eliminate inhomogeneous currents by electrode design.
In contrast to the CBKR method, in which the electrode dimensions need to match the sample dimensions, the PCBs used in the new method enable a rapid reuse of the same testing structure for samples of different dimensions.

*** DONE Waarde L_t is ingeschat, wat betekent dit?
Met samples van 1x1cm^2 betekent dit een flinke spreiding in mogelijke \phi_M, zeker in cylindrische samples (oftewel, naieve fpp setup).
Wanneer je precies aan de rand meet is er een minder groot probleem, zie Figuur \ref{fig:phiSolutionsEdge}.

Het zou mooi zijn als we L/L_t klein kunnen krijgen (~0.25 voor 1% error) zonder met ontzettend kleine ongecontroleerd gemaakte samples te hoeven werken.
Vandaar: translatiesymmetrie, met een grid van electrodes breng je in principe dezelfde randvoorwaardes aan als in het originele cartesiaanse geval (toelichting: symmetrie leidt tot \phi'(1) = 0).
Met hetzelfde sample kan je dus alsnog een veel kortere $L$ bereiken.

	abstract = {We describe {pH}-controlled selective etching of atomic layer deposition ({ALD}) Al2O3 over {ZnO}. Film thickness as a function of etch exposure was measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry. We ﬁnd that alkaline aqueous solutions with {pH} between about 9 and 12 will etch Al2O3 at useful rate with minimal attack of {ZnO}. Highly selective etching of Al2O3 over {ZnO} (selectivity {\textgreater}400:1) and an Al2O3 etch rate of ∼50 nm/min can be obtained using a {pH} 12 etch solution at 60 °C.},

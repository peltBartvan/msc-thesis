The analyzed tokens were searched for online. In addition, native speakers of Hijazi-Saudi Arabic confirmed the natural usage of the tokens in their dialect. The productivity of placing the FUTURE in front of the EGO and the unproductivity of placing it behind indicates the FUTURE in front of the EGO as the norm. Based on the metaphorical elements found in the tokens considered, a bidimensional conceptual location of objects on the JOURNEY OF TIME was proposed to include the front location or the elsewhere location. The elsewhere location was referred to as behind, extending the meaning of `behind' to include all locations that are not front. This bidimensionality is represented by the conceptual metaphors FOCUS IS FRONT and PERIPHERY IS BEHIND. Examples associated with these conceptual metaphors were associated with the experiential embodiment. In previous research, the direction of writing and how much weight is given to cultural values have claimed to influence the placement of the FUTURE in Arabic as pre-set reasons. This study is significant because it is done without pre-set reasons for metaphor usage, resulting in none-steered findings. Also, this study opens a window to the metaphorical system of the Hijazi-Saudi Arabic, a variety of Arabic whose metaphorical system is understudied. This study invites considering the placement of the FUTURE in other languages and cultures.},

The KMM does not take into account the interface resistance between metal and semiconductor, whereas the TLM disregards the vertical structure of the semiconductor layer. An extension of the TLM is derived (ETLM), which approximately considers this vertical structure. KMM and TLM thus appear as special cases of the ETLM. The calibration of the latter on the KMM then yields a simple quantitative criterion for the applicability of the KMM or the pure TLM. Measurement results on typical aluminum-silicon contacts are described satisfactorily by the (E)TLM. Concurrently with the applicability criterion, the KMM proves inadequate for these contacts due to the disregard of interface resistance. Conclusions are derived from the TLM pertaining to current distribution over the contact area and to contact resistance. In particular, the contacts are classified according to their operation mode. Finally, the TLM approach is applied also to circular contacts.},

  abstract = {Contact alloys were developed for use on a wide variety of GaAs devices such as high temperature transistors and Gunn oscillators. The alloys are composed of silver, indium and germanium for n-type GaAs and of silver, indium and zinc for p-type GaAs. Fabrication steps that require temperatures of up to 770\textdegree K for already contacted devices can be performed. GaAs transistors can be operated over a range from 20 to 770\textdegree K using Ag-In-Ge contacts for emitter and collector and Ag-In-Zn contacts for the base. Gunn oscillators have been built for the frequency range between 13 and 26 GHz with efficiencies as high as 3 percent at 15.8 GHz and as high as 1 percent at 25 GHz in continuous wave operation. A simple technique was developed to evaluate the specific contact resistance on thin epitaxial layers. Specific contact resistance is well below 10-4 {$\omega$}-cm2 on 0.1 {$\omega$}-cm or lower resistivity p- or n-type GaAs. The highest value was 1 \texttimes{} 10-3 {$\omega$}-cm2 measured on 0.6\textendash 2.6 {$\omega$}-cm n-type GaAs.

It is shown that in the shallow emitters of modern devices, the transport of carriers through the bulk of the emitter, and the surface recombination rate are the dominant mechanisms controlling the minority-carrier profile. Carrier recombination in the bulk of the emitter only produces a small perturbation of this profile. This observation permits us to develop a simple and accurate analytical model for the saturation current and internal quantum efficiency of shallow emitters.}

  abstract = {Possessing the ability to tune the work function and band gap of transparent conducting oxides (TCOs) is widely sought after, as it allows for improved band alignment in electronic and optoelectronic applications, enhancing overall device performance. Out of the many TCOs, Al-doped zinc oxide (AZO) has received considerable interest for electrode application due to its low electrical resistivity, high optical transparency in the visible regime, and room-temperature fabrication capability. In this study, we report on the effects of post fabrication air-annealing on the work function and band alignment of AZO deposited at room temperature by DC-magnetron sputtering. AZO films were air-annealed at temperatures varying from 25 \textdegree C (as-deposited) to 600 \textdegree C. The Fermi energy levels, work function values, surface chemistry, and optical band gaps of the AZO films were investigated via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and UV\textendash Vis spectroscopy. An increase of the work function from \textasciitilde 5.53 eV to \textasciitilde 6.05 eV is observed to take place over an increase of annealing temperatures from 25 \textdegree C (as-deposited) to 600 \textdegree C, determined to be the result of a decrease in carrier concentration through the promoted extinction of oxygen vacancies. Via XPS analysis, the increased extinction of oxygen vacancies was confirmed due to a notable shift from an oxygen-deficient state to an oxygen-sufficient state in the high resolution O 1s peaks, for which the activation energy was found to be 33.3 meV. Over the course of increasing annealing temperatures, the optical band gap saw a shift from \textasciitilde 3.55 eV to \textasciitilde 3.37 eV, following the Burstein-Moss phenomenon due to a decrease in carrier concentration, further verifying an increase in oxygen vacancy extinction. The reported results confirm that work function tuning of AZO films can be achieved through simple post-fabrication air-annealing.},

  abstract = {The fill factor of silicon wafer solar cells is strongly influenced by recombination currents and ohmic resistances. A practical upper limit for the fill factor of crystalline silicon solar cells operating under low-level injection is set by recombination in the quasi-neutral bulk and at the two cell surfaces. Series resistance, shunt resistance, and additional recombination currents further lower the fill factor. For process optimization or loss analysis of solar cells, it is important to determine the influence of both ohmic and recombination loss mechanisms on the fill factor. In this paper, a method is described to quantify the loss in fill factor due to series resistance, shunt resistance, and additional recombination currents. Only the 1-Sun J-V curve, series resistance at the maximum power point, and shunt resistance need to be determined to apply the method. Application of the method is demonstrated on an 18.4\% efficient inline-diffused p-type silicon wafer solar cell and a 21.1\% efficient heterojunction n-type silicon wafer solar cell. Our analysis does not require J-V curve fitting to extract diode saturation current densities or ideality factor; however, the results are shown to be consistent with curve fitting results if the cell's two-diode model parameters can be unambiguously determined by curve fitting.},

Short-run analyses focus on the cost-effectiveness of incremental increases in solar capacity, holding the rest of the power system fixed. Solar's variability adds value if its power occurs at high-demand times and displaces relatively carbon-intensive generation. Medium-run analyses consider the implications of non-incremental changes in solar capacity. The cost of each installation may fall through experience effects, but the cost of grid integration increases when solar requires ancillary services and fails to displace investment in other types of generation. Long-run analyses consider the role of solar in reaching twenty-first century carbon targets. Solar's contribution depends on the representation of grid integration costs, on the availability of other low-carbon technologies, and on the potential for technological advances. By surveying analyses for different time horizons, this paper begins to connect and integrate a fairly disjointed literature on the economics of solar energy.},

  abstract = {Stacks consisting of an ultrathin SiO2 coated with atomic-layer deposited (ALD) zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been shown to yield state-of-the-art passivation of n-type crystalline silicon surfaces. The distinguishing aspect of this novel passivation stack is the very conductive nature of the passivating ZnO layer. In this work, it is demonstrated that such a stack can provide additional functionalities relevant for silicon solar cells. Specifically, it is shown that the conductive and transparent stacks can passivate textured and n+-diffused silicon surfaces and that they can form an Ohmic contact to n+~-diffused surfaces with a low contact resistivity, provided the ZnO is Al-doped. The Al2O3 capping layer has previously been shown to be crucial in the passivation mechanism by preventing the effusion of hydrogen during annealing. Here, it is demonstrated to enable a significant improvement in both the transparency and lateral conductivity of the ZnO upon annealing as well, up to a level typically only attainable by In-based transparent conductive oxides. It is furthermore shown that the passivation of the stacks is thermally stable up to 500\textendash 600 oC, depending on the preparation method for the interfacial SiO2. Together, these properties make the presented stack an interesting building block for crystalline silicon solar cells, with possibilities for integration as passivating front contact in Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC)-like solar cells, e.g. as bottom cell top contact in silicon-perovskite tandem cells, as well as a conductive hydrogenation source for poly-Si passivating contacts.},

  abstract = {Extraction of contact resistivity ({$\rho$}c) with the four-point probe (4PP) method requires considerably fewer fabrication and measurement steps compared to conventional alternatives (e.g. the transfer length method, TLM). Yet, the method is rarely used, mainly due to the requirement of 3D simulations used in the data fitting procedure. Moreover, a work analyzing the details of the method, which can provide a quantitative guideline to the users, is lacking in the literature. In this work, we show that the 3D simulations can be replaced with a spreading resistance model (SRM) implemented in a numerical calculation platform (e.g. MATLAB). Using the SRM, we achieve drastically short calculation durations ({$<$}1~s) compared to durations of 3D simulations based on the finite element method. We show that the resolution and reliability of the extracted {$\rho$}c depends critically on geometrical and electrical parameters of the system, such as the probe tip spacing and sheet resistances of the layers. We also present an alternative measurement procedure that is fully based on 4PP measurements of only one substrate, which eliminates the need for an eddy-current measurement or an additional set of dedicated samples. We demonstrate the viability of the 4PP method in experiments by comparing the results with those obtained by the TLM, for {$\rho$}c between 5~\texttimes ~10-3 to 1~\texttimes ~100~{$\Omega~$}cm2. Lastly, we provide a free software that can execute the calculations discussed herein.},

  abstract = {Contacts featuring multiple layers of materials in combination with metal electrodes enabled record-high power conversion efficiencies for solar cells in recent years. Minimizing the contact resistivity in these multilayer structures is critical to achieve a high device performance and rapid characterization methods are crucial for the experimental analysis of this aspect. However, commonly used test methods and the associated mathematical formulations to extract contact resistivity are not designed for samples with multiple layers. In this work, we analyze formulations describing the resistance measured in ohmic multilayer test structures, which are used to fit and extract an unknown contact resistivity. We focus on a contacting scheme with circular electrodes, commonly named after Cox and Strack (CS), and analyze a material configuration consisting of a thick Si substrate fully coated with a thin conductive layer (CL). We demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of various spreading resistance models (SRMs) from the literature to calculate the measured resistance and compare the results with those obtained by the finite element method (FEM). Moreover, we present a new SRM with a closed-form expression for the measured resistance, which is computationally more efficient than the existing SRMs. Last, we demonstrate the applicability of this model in experiments with ( \$n\$ )c-Si/( \$i\$ )a-Si:H/( \$n\$ )a-Si:H/indium tin oxide (ITO) test structures.},

  abstract = {The Cox-Strack method is commonly applied to assess the contact resistivity between a metal and a semiconductor since the 1960s, while the underlying assumptions have not yet been rigorously assessed. In this article, a combination of finite-element modeling and mathematical analysis is used to investigate the accuracy of the conventional Cox-Strack equation for generic metal-semiconductor junctions. A systematic error in the spreading resistance equation is quantified, and alternative, more accurate equations are presented. Furthermore, it is shown that commonly used experimental configurations can lead to highly overestimated contact resistivities. Guidelines are formulated for accurate extraction of the contact resistivity from the Cox-Strack measurements.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a systematic evaluation of current crowding and spreading resistance in thin film contacts, based on the exact field solution that contains very large contrasts in dimensions and resistivity. It is found that current crowding becomes more severe as the interface specific contact resistivity decreases, the resistivity ratio of the contact electrode to the thin film decreases, or the thickness of either the contact or the thin film decreases. The current transfer length LT from our exact field solution is compared to that of transmission line model (TLM), LTLM = ({$\rho$}c/{$\rho$}sh)1/2, where {$\rho$}c is the interface specific contact resistivity, and {$\rho$}sh is the sheet resistance of the thin film under contact. It is found that, if {$\rho$}c is small, LT is bounded by the smaller of the two dimensions\textemdash thin film thickness and contact size. As {$\rho$}c increases, LT increases, but saturates at a constant value, determined by the smaller of the two dimensions\textemdash contact size and LTLM. The total contact resistance is decomposed into three components: the interface resistance due to {$\rho$}c, the spreading resistance due to current crowding, and the resistance due to the contact electrode. Unambiguously identified, each component is explicitly evaluated and compared in detail.},

  abstract = {The benefits and costs of increasing solar electricity generation depend on the scale of the increase and on the timeframe over which it occurs. Short-run analyses focus on the cost-effectiveness of incremental increases in solar capacity, holding the rest of the power system fixed. Solar's variability adds value if its power occurs at high-demand times and displaces relatively carbon-intensive generation. Medium-run analyses consider the implications of non-incremental changes in solar capacity. The cost of each installation may fall through experience effects, but the cost of grid integration increases when solar requires ancillary services and fails to displace investment in other types of generation. Long-run analyses consider the role of solar in reaching twenty-first century carbon targets. Solar's contribution depends on the representation of grid integration costs, on the availability of other low-carbon technologies, and on the potential for technological advances. By surveying analyses for different time horizons, this paper begins to connect and integrate a fairly disjointed literature on the economics of solar energy.},

  abstract = {Stacks consisting of an ultrathin SiO2 coated with atomic-layer deposited (ALD) zinc oxide (ZnO) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) have been shown to yield state-of-the-art passivation of n-type crystalline silicon surfaces. The distinguishing aspect of this novel passivation stack is the very conductive nature of the passivating ZnO layer. In this work, it is demonstrated that such a stack can provide additional functionalities relevant for silicon solar cells. Specifically, it is shown that the conductive and transparent stacks can passivate textured and n+-diffused silicon surfaces and that they can form an Ohmic contact to n+~-diffused surfaces with a low contact resistivity, provided the ZnO is Al-doped. The Al2O3 capping layer has previously been shown to be crucial in the passivation mechanism by preventing the effusion of hydrogen during annealing. Here, it is demonstrated to enable a significant improvement in both the transparency and lateral conductivity of the ZnO upon annealing as well, up to a level typically only attainable by In-based transparent conductive oxides. It is furthermore shown that the passivation of the stacks is thermally stable up to 500\textendash 600 oC, depending on the preparation method for the interfacial SiO2. Together, these properties make the presented stack an interesting building block for crystalline silicon solar cells, with possibilities for integration as passivating front contact in Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC)-like solar cells, e.g. as bottom cell top contact in silicon-perovskite tandem cells, as well as a conductive hydrogenation source for poly-Si passivating contacts.},

Realizing such passivating contacts in c-Si solar cells has become an important research objective, and an overview and classification of work to date on this topic is presented here. Using this overview, we discuss the design guidelines for passivating contacts and outline their prospects.},
